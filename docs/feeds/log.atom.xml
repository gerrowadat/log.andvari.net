&lt;p&gt;I'm now most of the way through the ~month or so I took off work.

&lt;p&gt;I'm now most of the way through the ~month or so I took off work. Around the start of it, I made a few plans, but I also resolved to unapologetically spend much of it just relaxing, and feeling non-guilty about that. It's something I've been working on, and I'm fairly pleased with the results. Sometimes the things you do are for you. It's one of the things I know and then steadfastly refuse my own counsel on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the outcomes was solving a few of the outstanding home and home automation things I've been loking at doing for ages. The above is a &lt;a href="https://shelly.cloud/"&gt;Shelly 1&lt;/a&gt; connected to the pinout of my garage door opener. I didn't have much say in what kind of opener and ended up with the kind with an Internet of Shit widget that just doesn't work properly, and a Manufacturer that don't take too kindly to hobbyists by not publishing any schematics. Thankfully, I happened to know that shorting two of the terminals on the back worked the same as a remote control press, and here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the outcomes (unplanned, but here we are) of this break was that i've started writing code agin in earnest. I hope it lasts when I go back to work; I partially credit &lt;a href="http://www.adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; and some nice folks over on the &lt;a href="http://irishtechcommunity.slack.com"&gt;Irish Tech community Slack&lt;/a&gt; for that -- but i've picked up on some other stuff as well. (btw, my attempts up until I ran ot of time are on &lt;a href="https://github.com/gerrowadat/adventofcode/tree/main/2020"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, including practicing on previous years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I guess if this is the last entry for another year or two, you'll know how going back to work went).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="tech"></category></entry><entry><title>December 31 2020</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/december-31-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-31T15:40:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-31T15:40:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2020-12-31:/december-31-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20201231-homeassistant.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20201231-homeassistant.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last attempt at doing the Home Automation/Domotics/Whatyacallit a few years back mostly involved buying expensive widgets, determining they are shite, or marketed at US power and outlets, and then discovering that setup and upgrades generally involved one ore more of downloading a random .exe from random websites …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20201231-homeassistant.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20201231-homeassistant.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last attempt at doing the Home Automation/Domotics/Whatyacallit a few years back mostly involved buying expensive widgets, determining they are shite, or marketed at US power and outlets, and then discovering that setup and upgrades generally involved one ore more of downloading a random .exe from random websites, soldering, or tracking the ongoing battle between hardware manufacturers and hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, things have gotten a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; better in the last few years. One of my personal projects in the time off over xmas this year was finally fiddling with &lt;a href="https://www.hass.io"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, which got done on the houses's brand new &lt;a href="https://www.k3s.io"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; cluster (but, more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been, quite honestly, a breath of fresh air. I might be a little unhappy with HA devs racing to the bottom in terms of what market to cater for (but that's purely a selfish concern), but it's...refreshing to see an ecosystem of support build around something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helps that manufacturers like &lt;a href="https://shelly.cloud/"&gt;Shelly&lt;/a&gt; are openly suporting offline use and flashing their kit to something like &lt;a href="https://tasmota.github.io/"&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt;. One of the key concerns last time was just how flakey it all was - and subject to the whims of manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still working on the trickier parts of integrating the random assortment of Internet of Shit devices at home, but this is a very promising start.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="tech"></category></entry><entry><title>December 09 2020</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/december-09-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-09T01:28:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-09T01:28:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2020-12-09:/december-09-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20201209-brainwork.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20201209-brainwork.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've set both a really good example (take your vacation!) and a really bad example (Don't leave it all til the last minute!) for work folks, and therefore today was my last day at work in 2020. It's been a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I'm especially looking forward …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20201209-brainwork.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20201209-brainwork.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've set both a really good example (take your vacation!) and a really bad example (Don't leave it all til the last minute!) for work folks, and therefore today was my last day at work in 2020. It's been a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I'm especially looking forward to this time round is taking on projects and doing things in an active way -- a lot of the time, my primary complaint when I take some time off is that I get to the end and feel like I've wasted it. I often feel like I can't get things done because there's some crucial thing I need to box all my time off for. A few months back, someone casually remarked to me that that sounded like burnout. So, taking this time was one of the things I wanted to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other was actually going and doing something about some of the ways my brain worked. That means drugs and therapy. I'd done some advocacy work (where I could) at work around mental health, and even while I was doing that, I kinda realised I felt a bit hypocritical, because I was basically untreated (aside from a few abortive attempts to go to a therapist that amounted to being handed a burned CD of whale noises and being told to google &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"&gt;CBT&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, long story short, I've been back on SSRIs (I was on them for a brief time about 10 years ago), and I'm seeing a much more engaged and useful therapy person. It's been pretty great, actually. I feel a lot more like myself again - like a version that isn't really struggling as much, without the mind racing constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the side-effects of this, of course, is that I've started to write code and do some wee projects again. I hadn't felt up to this in a long time. Probably years. It's a good feeling. What's helping right now is &lt;a href="http://www.adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;, but I've also got a few things going at home. Hence the picture of the haul of RPi stuff -- which I do intend to write some more technical posts on, as I progress. A month off is long enough to form some good habits; maybe logging more stuff is one of them? No Promises :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my list is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RPi cluster to replace an aging NUC machine, probably running &lt;a href="http://www.microk8s.io"&gt;MicroK8s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Shelly lightswitches (they run over WiFi, and can be flashed with &lt;a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/"&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably other Zigbee stuff, assuming it arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiddling with &lt;a href="http://www.home-assistant.io"&gt;HA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also fiddling with &lt;a href="http://www.mycroft.ai/"&gt;Mycroft&lt;/a&gt;, possibly as a replacement for Google Assistant (Nothing against it as such, but I do want more stuff to work when we've no internet at home).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note at this point that I do tend to go big or go home on hobbyist stuff. A month is a long time, let's see where we get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, some decompression. And to put up the tree.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category></entry><entry><title>November 22 2020</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/november-22-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-22T19:08:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-22T19:08:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2020-11-22:/november-22-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Short a quick trip to Zurich in January 2020, the trip I was on was the last time I travelled outside Ireland, until now.

I also don't plan on going anywhere until mid-2021 or thereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as all that's been written about how this year has been, one of the largest lessons I take away from it is that it called me and many folks in probably a similar position on some assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if you didn't have to go to work every day? Either because you were a remote worker, or just because. You'd have more 'time in the day', fewer excuses about getting exercise and eating healthy, and so on. Notwithstanding that COVID has been a terrible experience for pretty much everyone, after a certain point you have to get to something like normalcy, and see if it's what you expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I put on a load of weight, didn't really leave the house for a few months, and went back on SSRIs. I found a good therapist and I've mostly got the extra few kilos back off again, with more to come. It took a while but I think I am adjusting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always had in my mind that I'd take some time off before I retire. By 'some', I mean maybe a year or two. It always seemed strange to me that people would work until they're in their late 60s, after they've lost the ability, freedom and inclination to do the things they can't do because of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an imaginary expectation that if I suddeny didn't have to go to work any more, that fulfilment and relaxation would fill the gaps -- in reality, I really hadn't thought about it all that much. If I stopped working tomorrow, I would enjoy the situation for...maybe a month? Two months? I'd then have to do something. My platonic ideal had been having nothing to do, and now I know that just makes me anxious :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past 9 months has been a microcosm of that. My last almost 20 years has been me being on the road every month or two, and that's all gone now. Do I miss it? Honestly, no. I enjoyed some parts of travel, there were good experiences; but I'm really not crazy to get back on the road again. I could take or leave business travel, honestly. I often said before that the amount of business travel I do kinds ruins holidays for me - the minute I go near the airport I'm in work mode. I'm trying to manage the situation, and getting stressed about everything going smoothly, and waiting for the trip to be over so I can go home. So in some ways I am kinda looking forward to travel for travel's sake again. But, I can wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write more words about the future of work than will fit here -- I think this year has been an accelerant to that progress, but we are heading toward a brick wall where we have to deal with the social nature of humans and how we can't substitute that with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Same time next year?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="catchup"></category></entry><entry><title>November 09 2019</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/november-09-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-09T14:14:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-09T14:14:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2019-11-09:/november-09-2019.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20191109-choochoobrains.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20191109-choochoobrains.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been over two years, and while I'm still patiently waiting for the demise of &lt;a href="http://www.medium.com/"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, it only took re-running &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/a&gt; to make my makefiles work again.

Plus we haven't deprecated serving static content just yet, so there's that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the selling points for blog platforms these days is some sort of federation thing, or the promise that more people will read your nonsense, or other stuff that's nothing to do with producing an actual log. It's something LiveJournal got right, in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I'm on a train from work on Seattle, to San Jose, which is also near work. In a toss-up between getting a 2-hour flight and sitting on my ass in the bay area for two days, I choose....22-hour train journey. It's being a pretty good opportunity to switch off, when these are few and far between these days, more than I'd care to admit. The very fact that I'm on the (offline editing) blog thing will give you an idea of the extent of the problem I have with disconnecting :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I last took the &lt;a href="https://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train"&gt;Coast Starlight&lt;/a&gt; maybe 8 or 9 years ago, that time from Oakland to Los Angeles. I remember it as a fascinating drive-by of some of the smaller parts of American life -- as someone who's really never visited the USA for pleasure purposes, it's easy to forget it's where millions of people live in small towns, and rolling past and getting a look at that brings me a sense of ease that even with an open text editor (the modern equivalent of a notebook), I can't properly try to express with words. It's a good feeling and I'll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip to the Pacific Northwest, short as it was, was also a good reminder that it's a place I enjoy being at. Maybe it's the weather? Or the closeness to nature in the planning of the city. Anyway, it puts me in a mind to having a go at coming here for nonwork reasons. That doesn't happen a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayway, that's yisser lot. Like always, I promise myself I'll update this more, if my brain is in the space to do so. And, most likely like always, it never bubbles to the top. Seeya when I see you :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="catchup"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>An Update on Life</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/an-update-on-life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-06T11:15:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-06T11:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2017-02-06:/an-update-on-life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been a bit hectic, let's say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In work, a few things happened. I got promoted to 'Director', which is the top end of the management progression, bottom of executive. What either of these mean, I'll probably never know. About a year or so ago, I expressed a bit of existential angst about how my job had become more about pottering about among the various pies I had a finger in, making generally well-meaning statements and giving advice. I felt like I wasn't getting a lot of work done, frankly. My boss at the time said "This is what a Director does", and that was a bit terrifying. I guess now I know what it feels like (all over again) to go from full-time engineering getting-things done to management, yet done in some other stratum. Your tolerance for delayed gratification has to go up another notch, as the stuff I'm up to now has a 3-5 year timeframe, as opposed to yearly or so, as opposed to quarterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been fun times thus far. Trying to find the balance between getting stuff done, and being hands-off. I honestly think getting this balance right is one of the primary things that stands in a middle manager's favour - the balance between getting stuck in and not letting the people under you grow, and feeling like you're not really doing anything. It's also a very situational thing. Every time I've gotten promoted in the last 5 years or so, I've thought "Right, that's me I guess. Topped out.". What this means in my head is that I've honestly no idea or concrete advice for other folks who want to go down the same path. Every Director I've ever spoken to about it had a different story. They're not going to tell you how to do it, they can only tell you how they did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that happened is that I guess I'm now head of SRE for Dublin. Again, this role means different things for different people - I'm not terribly figurehead-y in some ways, and I'm lucky to have lots of great folks around me to make sure I get mercilessly taken down a notch if I'm doing not enough or too much of things. I'm also happy to be back into the 'existential terror' mode of operation. I believe everyone should be reasonably sure they can do about 80% of their job. The other 20% are what keeps it interesting. This only happened a month ago, so I'm still figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of stuff here as well! I am adulting very much, after a few years of not so much. I am generally bad at adulting so this is good, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, and I guess most significantly - myself and my partner of 8 years now live together properly and for realsies. There are various and sundry private reasons why this wasn't the case, and the thing that happened to make this happen is also private, but this is a big deal for me - sharing my life with someone else in so complete a way is a new thing for me (yes, despite being nearly 40, I've never actually lived with someone I was going out with). This has done wonders for my general well-being, in many, many small ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi-related - we're selling the house I bought almost 3 years ago, and moving into Dublin city proper. This was something I was thinking about for a long while, and the above thing also precipitated it. There are a couple of reasons why this is happening now, which I guess are relevant to most commuter-town folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, I currently live about 40km outside Dublin, and I work in about as far east (i.e. the opposite end) in Dublin as you can. I commute by car or motorbike mostly, and it takes about an hour, at best. I've been doing this for 10 years. I had figured this was worth it, as I like having privacy, space, and so forth. Also, the way the property market is, you get about twice as much bang for your buck compared to living in Dublin. Even if there were houses and gardens the size of our current place in Dublin, you're talking most of a million quid, whereas we're selling up for not even close to half that, and doing well out of it. Things are amazingly Dublin-centric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the reasons break down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commute finally killing me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's getting worse rather than better. Economy is recovering, lots of people have cars and need to use them. My commute took 45-50 minutes on a good day 2-3 years back. right before christmas, I had a few days where it took over 2 hours. Fuck everything about that noise. I think having the motorbike took the sting out for a bit, but I realised back in the middle of last year that I was literally driving into Dublin every day, including weekends. Why don't I live there? Good question, obvious answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health (mental and phyiscal).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live along a main road. There's nowhere to walk if you don't like being run over by a truck. You have to drive everywhere. What this meant in practical terms is that I got little to no exercise, unless I made a point of it, drove to a place, exercised (walking, cycling, etc.), and then loaded up and went home. Back when I lived in Dublin before and moved out to the country, I distinctly remember putting on about 10kg just by missing out on the walk to the bus stop or down the shops. I spent a good chunk of the last 2 years getting literally no exercise. Walk 10 feet to the car, into and out of work, then that's it. I've put in about another 10kg in the lat 2 years, with really no sign of it slowing down. There was really only one way that was going. I'm not a gym person, and I find it very difficult to rationalise or will myself to get exercise that doesn't have a 'point'. I'm the least physically fit and heaviest I've ever been right now. I'm getting to an age where that's actually pretty dangerous. I'd rather wake up now than in a few years when I have my first coronary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it's just secluded. I don't have an active social life. I went to a pub a few weeks back on a whim, and realised I haven't done that in probably a year or more. All the folks I'd go to the pub with are either work peope, or live in Dublin. I already have pretty severe social anxiety, that isn't getting helped by living in a hermitage. So, even if it makes me a bit uncomfortable, something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services for peope who live outside cities and large towns are getting worse, rather than better. Ireland has always been a city-centric (and specifically Dublin-centric) country, and this shows no signs of going in the other direction. Broadband is pathetic (I get about 50Mb on an LTE connection, with a 20GB per day download limit). In the last few years, getting tradespeople to come out to a place has gotten harder as the economy picks up. Case in point, my electric gates broke down a few weeks back. The original installer said "I won't be able to come out to you for at least 3 weeks", and replied "dunno" when I asked what else I could do. Rural Ireland is kind of fucked. By that I mean living outside towns. I could move down the road a mile and probably do a lot better with services - the appetite to go the last mile is just not there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because I can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been pretty lucky in that I have a job that pays well, and I really don't have any outlays or expensive habits (aside from Airsoft kit, which granted isn't that expensive in the grander scheme of things, if you compare it to golf or something).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have the ability to live in Dublin, that I perhaps less so had 10 years ago, when I first moved out. So, it's time to embrace the privilege a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, all these reasons got written down sometime last year, and we started looking, as well as putting our place on the market. It sold reasonably quickly, and right now we're going to rent for a bit and take our time. I'm going to have to get used to some stuff I used to take for granted (being able to walk! to a shop! public transport! taxis that don't cost 80 quid!), and I'm looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of the above manifests itself as my being a ball of abject stress for probably the next 6-12 months. But, it'll all be worth it, right?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="life"></category></entry><entry><title>June 12 2016</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/june-12-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-12T12:04:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-06-12T12:04:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2016-06-12:/june-12-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20160612-nespresso.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20160612-nespresso.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was away last week with work to an offsite at the &lt;a href="https://www.clubmed.co.uk/r/Opio-en-Provence/y"&gt;Club Med&lt;/a&gt;, which as far as I can

&lt;p&gt;Bizarrely, the weather in Ireland was actually better than in the south of France. No complaints though :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the weather at home is fighting with itself -- sunshine and high (for Ireland) temperatures, with "showers" that range
in intensity from light drizzle to attempted murder. Will still try to bike it to work as I can this week. Actually the first
full week in many weeks, so trying to git 'er done moreso than I have been.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category></entry><entry><title>June 05 2016</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/june-05-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-05T19:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-06-05T19:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2016-06-05:/june-05-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20160605-rhubarb.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20160605-rhubarb.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much as we all need to get grunge work done, often the 'fair' way to divide it is unfair to everyone individually. 
People work best where they get to do one thing well for as long an uninterrupted session of time as possible. It's a
concept that I get pushed back on quite a bit, as it's dangerously close to claiming human can't multitask, and people 
love to claim they can. But, it's a pretty simple concept that's worked well where applied.

&lt;p&gt;In since-last-year news, things are progressing, for certain values of progress. As far as the Internet at large is concerned,
 I now have about twice as many people who have the good|bad|indifferent fortune of being in my organisation at work (I know,
"my organisation", right?). Things have gotten really busy since about the start of this year, but in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my solemn belief that the average person should know how to do about 90% of their job. Thereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a chapter for the &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do"&gt;SRE Book&lt;/a&gt;. Not on anything technical
of course. On manager-nerd stuff. A dabbler in code and people. It was a paper I'd had sitting internally for a while, that 
is now seeing the light of day, in edited form. I am glad this book exists, as I have honestly believed that what we're doing is
capital-I Important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather's turning. It's one of those nice times of year when it's cold and mostly dry, but without a winter in front of us. Things are growing at home and we're seeing what pops up on our first spring in the new place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on Valentine's day, I reminded myself of how much I love myself, and got a new motorbike. It's the little things. Love you lots babe xoxo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently in London, doing a short trip for work. Have managed only short trips so far (to Zurich, and now here) -- I've a few longer trips coming up, but they should be mostly uneventful. I don't have the appetite for long trips any more, to anywhere. There's too much at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the weather gets nicer, I also mean to get fitter (i.e. fitter than not fit at all). The house buying moved us further out from work, and introduced stress that means I've been off the self-powered bike for a while. I've a pretty big &lt;a href="http://www.borderwar.cz"&gt;Airsoft Event&lt;/a&gt; coming up in April, and not dropping dead from running for a few hundred metres would be just great. I'm funny with exercise in that I can't stick to it unless it has a point. So, bike commuting was great. Gym, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I say this after inhaling a &lt;a href="http://www.fortyburgers.co.uk/"&gt;Pretty Nice Burger&lt;/a&gt; in a local place here.

The first week back at work was one of those stealth first-weeks-back, where the first part is relief that nothing exploded in my 3 weeks away, and the rest was EVERYTHING HAPPENING.

&lt;p&gt;Domestic weekend! The first week back at work was one of those stealth first-weeks-back, where the first part is relief that nothing exploded in my 3 weeks away, and the rest was EVERYTHING HAPPENING. But it's the weekend now, and Amazon has a fancy Karcher window vacuum on sale. A window vacuum, if you don't mind. It actually worked, which restored my faith in branding (I wouldn't have bothered with one and would have declared them bullshit if Karcher hadn't been making one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somoene mentioned &lt;a href="http://www.medium.com/"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; to me last week, as a means to 'tweet a thing with more words than a tweet'. Over the years, I've used a bunch of things to keep an accessible log. I used to use &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; until some russian mobsters bought it. I used to keep up with people on some NNTP groups, or via email. I don't really do email with people any more, which is a shame in a sort of compresed-time way. Remember when we used to write letters? I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm pretty sure that some HTML files in a directory aren't going to get deprecated or fall out of favour any time soon. I can carry a means to reproduce them anywhere with me, I can rejigger them to some other format if the world moves on, I can use some other form of syndication, because I have the originals in markdown. You could argue that it won't fall out of favour because it isn't in favour, and you'd be right :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think about how temporary a lot of social media is. People from the older school of personal journaling or websites came into it with an expectation that it'd be a record of their travels through life. It really hasn't become that, and I think that's fine - it is what it defines itself to be, which is a moving set of goalposts. Will Facebook be around in 40+ years, when I hope to be still here? I don't know, and neither do you. Will it offer a means to search for the times I talked about a particular thing at any point in the past? It doesn't even do that now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just in the interests of fairness, neither do G+ or twitter in any meaninfgul way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, all this is a huge distraction from how I need to clean my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="logging"></category><category term="domestic"></category><category term="weekend"></category></entry><entry><title>January 01 2015</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/january-01-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-01T02:05:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-01-01T02:05:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2015-01-01:/january-01-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20150101-desk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20150101-desk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, every October or so, I ask HR at work for a report of people on my team (I have somehow tricked The Company, or they have tricked me, into being responsible for about 40 people) who haven't taken enough vacation, since we can only carry over 5 days.

&lt;p&gt;So, every October or so, I ask HR at work for a report of people on my team (I have somehow tricked The Company, or they have tricked me, into being responsible for about 40 people) who haven't taken enough vacation, since we can only carry over 5 days. Due to accounting messing about for my leave earlier this year, It turns out I had 17 days left, and could only carry over 5. "Whoops", I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I took 3 weeks off. My leave in the summer was good, and overdue, but stressful and punctuated by having to call people, stand over people as they do jobs, worry about things going well (Ever had to hope a plumber has a steady hand drilling a hole in a 500 euro ceramic sink, as you race to a kitchen suppliers to get parts they forgot to send out and you needed today? That was a fun tuesday morning). A lot of it felt a lot more like work than I would have liked. So, this time round, I made a small list of "Things I will feel like a failure as a person for not getting done". I then promptly did about half of them, then declared "Fuck it, it's Christmas" and sat around enjoying the outcome of the previous time spent working. It has been glorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 has been one of the more eventful years in the last few. Of course, I moved house, for the first time in almost 10 years. The above picture is my workbench for doing electronics messing and airsoft, which only got unpacked and set up this week. This will give you an idea of my approach to moving. I still have a roomful of boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did more of my "Doing things is better than not doing things" stuff. For me, as an on-again off-again &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder"&gt;GAD&lt;/a&gt; sufferer, this has brought about an amazing sense of well-being. The alternative to figuring out how to be alive like this is the slow death of coasting through life without ever challenging yourself. I'm doing it in small way. I'm not about to take up lion-taming, but I'm doing my bit. I did the mandatory training and started riding a motorcycle, which was a big unnecessary thing I thought would help, and it has. It's easy (and especially easy for me) to rationalise away any thoughts of doing things that aren't strictly necessary - it's a defence mechanism against failure. I'm trying my best to do things when my brain goes "Bleh". I'm also trying my best to fulfil a few of the "Wouldn't it be cool if..." ideas I often have and then squirrel away for 'later'. There's no later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopes for 2015? I'm trying hard to have specific ones. It's not something I think about a lot, and the 'five year plans are for losers' attitude that got me through my 20s has worn thin a little bit. So, I'm still thinking about it. I hope I can do more stuff that I've only thought of doing but then threw away the idea before. I hope I can figure out a reproducible way of making myself happy. I hope I can be a better partner, a better manager, and a more open person without stressing myself out or being uncomfortable all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with doing things. Because that is, after all, better than not doing things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category></entry><entry><title>December 07 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/december-07-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-07T13:48:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-12-07T13:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-12-07:/december-07-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20141207-goodjob.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20141207-goodjob.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of this year's travel is ongoing. I haven't had a weekend in NYC in a while, and it's managed not to snow this time. A decent day yesterday walking around the park and times square in the rain, and visiting &lt;a href="http://www.moma.org/"&gt;MoMA&lt;/a&gt; for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week is more synergy - a meeting of managers from all over to talk about The Company's storage, the teams that run it, and various other bits. It's the stuff I'm interested enough in that it doesn't feel like work. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here until thursday or so, the heading home to a bunch of time off for xmas and new years. I've alwys taken the two weeks surrounding xmas and new year's off, for my entire working life. Of course, this means that the week before the week before xmas always ends up being an exercise in clock-watching (yes, even if I do like my job. It's not quite at the level of 'xmas every day' just yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this year, I took that week off as well. I'm sure nothing bad can come of this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>November 12 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/november-12-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-12T22:15:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-11-12T22:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-11-12:/november-12-2014.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20141112-cats.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20141112-cats.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent korean BBQ is a lot less cheaty than sausage and stodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mountain View is as it usually is, except it feels a lot more like it's reached its tipping point as far as straining the local infrastructure goes. People don't want to live near the office (because let's face it, Mountain View itself is a bit of a shithole), so they end up commuting &amp;gt;1h from San Francisco (which is also a shithole) every day. At some point, being in the centre of the universe gets outweighed by a declining quality of life. Hopefully something creative happens, since I don't think it's a problem unique to The Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more day in the office, then hitting the red-eye to NYC tomorrow night. I expect that to be a less pleasant flight, but at least I'll then be in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>October 21 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/october-21-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-21T21:36:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-21T21:36:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-10-21:/october-21-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20141021-munichmenu.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20141021-munichmenu.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a work conference in Munich, which I've never been to before. From what I have seen of restaurants here, it is a Paleo disaster, so I've been pretty cheat-y so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get to spend essentially no free time here, but maybe I'll come back sometime. For now, I get to go back home for a week, then do a short-in-duration but long-in-distance jaunt.

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I own a motorbike now! It's a 2004 Honda NT650V Deauville. It'll do for now - I meanly needed a bigger bike after I discovered that the 250cc bike I was on was hardly pulling me, and I found it way, way easier to ride the school bike (an SV650S). Of course, I'd pick a day with gale-force winds to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also booked my test, on advice of the instructor - I did an insurance assessment and was given a grade equivalent to 'has a full license and is a daily rider'. Which had the nice side-effect of 30% off my insurance. Let's hope I can keep that up when I don't have a dude following me and roaring at me over a radio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="motorbike"></category></entry><entry><title>October 05 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/october-05-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-05T11:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-05T11:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-10-05:/october-05-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20141005-steak.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20141005-steak.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to keep this thing up by doing worthwhile things. That was the idea, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying &lt;a href="http://thepaleodiet.com/"&gt;Paleo&lt;/a&gt; for the last few weeks, with a drop of about 1.1kg per week so far. Seems normal enough for exercise free diet change (from previous experience), and it's a bit easier on the palate than just caloric reduction or other stuff - we'll see how long it lasts. I've noticed a bit more energy certainly, and less feeling bloated and horrible. The first couple of weeks off work really took it out of me, and the brain can't really perform if the body isn't keeping up. It's too far out to be cycling to work any more, so diet will have to come first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorbike stuff is still in the pant-shitting terror mode for a lot of it, which I hear is quite normal and healthy. I know I see it in the car as well, but inconsiderate arseholes are legion on Irish roads - people should have to spend some time on a bike or motorbike to understand this. On the other hand, we've had some great weather the last few weeks, and I'm enjoying the hell out of the long straight bits. Back in this week for some more refresher lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have also solidified travel for the next while - going to Munich, London, Mountain View and NYC before the end of the year; in short trips for the most part. Also, got a ticket for &lt;a href="http://www.borderwar.cz/"&gt;Border War&lt;/a&gt; next year - I'm so there I'm not even here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="motorbike"></category></entry><entry><title>September 16th 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/september-16th-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-16T14:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-09-16T14:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-09-16:/september-16th-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20140916-zurich.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20140916-zurich.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Away in Zurich for a few days with work. Partially to meet a bunch of people, but also to get into the practice of being away from home in small doses. I've a few more trips coming up (London, Munich, etc) that'll also help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been dealing with a bit of low-level anxiety about leaving the house empty - it's a good bit more secluded than the old place, which means I don't like leaving it alone. For this and a few future trips, I have someone going in there pretty much every day (or living there), but I just have to deal with it -- Alarm systems, CCTV, home automation only go so far. If stuff happens, it happens. Bizarrely, in my head it's the cats I'd be more worried about. Stuff is just stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Zurich in June, but didn't get to see any of it -- so I'm getting around this time by walking. I really like old european cities, where people actually use the space. It's one of the things I don't like about Dublin -- people don't look like they're using the space and kind of scurry around between Things They Gotta Do. Hard to explain. What I have learned is that I need a comfortable pair of walking shoes, and to become less of a fat sack of shit (I stopped getting any regular exercise right when I bought the new house and stress took over. Need to reverse that trend.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to do some gaming over the weekend at &lt;a href="http://iga.ie/heckcon/"&gt;Heckcon&lt;/a&gt;, which was nice - I've been trying to do a little more of this, since it was one of the things I consciously enjoyed that I just petered out with doing. I'm getting set up for &lt;a href="http://www.gaelcon.com/"&gt;Gaelcon&lt;/a&gt; in a month or so, and may even run a game. There's also a set of people that I only really run into at cons, and it'll be good to get kept up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="gaming"></category></entry><entry><title>September 12th 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/september-12th-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-12T21:11:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-09-12T21:11:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-09-12:/september-12th-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20140912-windscreen.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Whoops!" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20140912-windscreen.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second week back, and seeing what my job ends up looking like for the next while. Think 'busy'. I'm trying to nail down travel until the end of the year, it being increasingly impossible. I'll be in Zurich for a while next week, and after that is anyone's guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other delightful happenings: Someone working on another building in the campus our building is in managed to reverse a van into the motorbike. The only real damage was to the airblade windscreen, which got broken pretty much clean in half (see picture). After removing the remains, I discovered that all it was really doing was redirecting wind into my face, and riding the bike got a bit nicer to do.

&lt;p&gt;Last day of leave, and a day of normalcy and domesticity. Mainly hung around and enjoyed the last of the days since the end of June, when I last went near work. Tomorrow will see some hectic times, when I figure out what's happened while I've been away. If I've been doing it right, very little! The best work disappears, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These few months off have given me a bit of time to think about larger things -- I've gotten a lot of stuff done, and have thought about a lot more stuff. My brain has not been terribly healthy these last few years, and part of what I hoped to figure out was what I might end up doing (or not doing) to make it be a little healtier. I had a couple of bad signs, like mood swings that weren't linked to any external stimuli, that mean I may end up seeing a professional again at some point. However, on other fronts things are a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, I've finally acknowledged that I'm actually not made happy by being lazy. The last proper frame of reference I had with enough time to introspect on it was college and soon after, where I could do stuff like spend a week playing Baldur's Gate, or similar goofing off. I often stressed myself out in recent years because I don't seem to get the time to do that sort of thing any more. However, given the opportunity to do so, I found myself not really able for it - the thought of not doing something productive, or not doing something at least worthwhile outweighed the stress for not being able to goof off (if that makes sense). So tl;dr: The marathon laziness sessions I get stressed about not doing are actually bad for me when I get to do them. I don't like them. The reason in my head, at least, seems to be that the part of my brain that wants things is a bit disconnected from the part that enjoys experiences and feeds back. It also probably means that I did some growing as a person without really noticing. So, I got to rationalise away a source of stress :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another: this leave almost acted as a catalyst for realising what I'm going to do, ever, and what I'm not going to do. For a long time, I've had in the back of my brain "Someday I'll do X", where X is a thing that's completely possible for me to do now. Someday I'll go travel in a particular place. Someday I'll learn a particular skill. It'll happen in the empty space that I can retionalise away as "When I have time off work". I just had time off work, and only got one or two of these things done (the motorcycle thing, and some other social things I may go into later). Now that I'm back at work, I realise: there is no later. Unless you're prepared to make a long list and wait for retirement (and hope you make it in one piece and are able-bodied enough to tick them off) you're just not going to do these things. You sweep them away forward into a fold in time, which usually means 'never'. So, if I find myself going "I'd like to do X sometime when I've time", the time is now. Or soon. Make plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been extraordinarily lucky in my work life - I have a job I love doing, that pays well and is flexible about lifestyle. I have a Significant Other that is the world to me, and that I want to share my life with if I can. I have most of my life left to make of it what I can. The last thing I need is self-denial and some-other-time'ism holding me back. I need to keep that in my head as I get back into a routine, so it doesn't become too routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if I could find my work ID, this would all be a lot more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="leave"></category><category term="work"></category><category term="brain"></category></entry><entry><title>August 23rd 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/august-23rd-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-08-23T22:24:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-08-23T22:24:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-08-23:/august-23rd-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20140823-bike.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nyowm" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20140823-bike.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that's left is to clear out the old house of stuff I care about, and point the "Make ready for new tenants" ray-gun at it, care of the local letting agent. Hopefully I'll get that done early next week, just in time for a few days off with nothing to do before going back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, all in all, that despite the house move taking up a big chunk of my 2 months off, I'm still an awful lot happier with how things have turned out than if I'd kept trying to do it while working full-time. I can't imagine having done all this properly with only evenings and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I was at a large (well, the largest of its kind in Ireland), &lt;a href="http://troops-in-contact.com/"&gt;Airsoft game&lt;/a&gt;, which meant a lot of driving and walking around, and not a lot of sleep.

My feeble hu-man body is still getting over it, via some seriously lazy weekdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow should see the beginnings of the hideous sickly-yellow colour the previous owners painted the outside of the house disappearing, to be replaced by a hopefully less sickly light green. I am not pretending to be even remotely competent at painting, so we're getting someone in to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, I've been taking the last few weeks of my leave to spend time with favourite lady, enjoy the new place, and get to some nerding -- I've been messing about with LightwaveRF and getting it working nicely with my existing z-wave setup (and learning LUA and writing more golang in the process).

&lt;p&gt;A week between updates, but it's been a reasonably busy one. Still moving a bunch of stuff from the old house, still trying to get out on the (motor)bike every day or so (in between impressive rainshowers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was a small get-together with some folks, as a bit of a "Yep, I definitely live here now" wake-up call. The smaller touches are also happening, like home automation and the like. I think tis is possibly the first day I've been able to sit in the office and get some solid nerding done. I'm currently experimenting with using &lt;a href="http://www.lightwaverf.co.uk/"&gt;LightwaveRF&lt;/a&gt; stuff for light switches, since their switch gear is a bit cheaper and more predictable tan z-wave (which I'm using for everything else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I have to sort out some smaller bits (like the CCTV company that have left me waiting a solid 3 weeks to finish an install. Bad show, &lt;a href="ttp://www.macalarms.ie/"&gt;MAC Alarms&lt;/a&gt;). Also, some more moving (I still havent'e mptied the old house. The last big job is getting that rented out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I picked up the rest of the bike gear/PPE, so all I'm missing now is a bike. And for this rain to feck off so it's safe to ride it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week looks like it's moving the rest of the stuff from the old house, and finding a rental agency that wants to turn the old house from a mess into paying tenants. Possibly interspersed with bike shopping, but there's no rush on that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category><category term="bike"></category><category term="house"></category></entry><entry><title>July 30th 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/july-30th-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-30T16:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-07-30T16:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-07-30:/july-30th-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20140730-attic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="So Cable" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20140730-attic.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I had originally intended to take a month off, and was convinced to take 2 by a co-worker. In retrospect, only taking a month would have been a mistake. I think I'm only really getting into things now, 4 weeks in. Having to go back to work next monday would be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computers/gear/network gubbins are mostly set up in the new place, which makes things more tolerable entertainment-wise. The software side of it will come together - I use &lt;a href="https://github.com/gerrowadat/angryweetabix"&gt;angryweetabix&lt;/a&gt; to do a lot of the automation stuff, and will have to do stuff like turn downloads off while I'm at home (Internet connection going from 200Mb-&amp;gt;6Mb), and various other bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days are a bit busier, my bike training is tomorrow, and Favourite Lady gets home as well.

&lt;p&gt;Friday night, I got one of the annoying headaches I get if I get too tired or stressed, so that, if nothing else, was the sign that it was time for a break. So, yesterday and today was mostly lounging around, being amused by the cats noticing things. There's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more wildlife outside the windows of this house (more kinds of birds, rabbits and hares, and a local cat they haven't seen yet). It's been a tiring experience when you've got lots of things to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ping has stopped hiding, at least, which is encouraging. She's more of a creature of habit, and didn't explore the house at all the first day. She's currently trotting around smelling things, so that's good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I get to do some delicious physical labour, moving things from the old house, and moving lumber and various bits from the back garden to the site of the skip I really must get for it one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week is probably the first week with nothign house-related scheduled -- the only thing scheduled is my &lt;a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/"&gt;IBT&lt;/a&gt; course on thurs/fri, and some &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/dndnext.aspx"&gt;nerd stuff&lt;/a&gt; on thursday evening.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was Moving Day for small cats everywhere. As predicted, Stranger didn't care and just wanted her head scratched, and Ping stared bloody murder and found some hiding places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight was uneventful, aside from the CCTV making noises at 0330 and complaining about SMART errors. Guess it doesn't like being on its side. Whoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am generally being around so the cats can have some semblance of normality, and I can catch up on lounging. Some goodies arrived from &lt;a href="http://www.vesternet.com/"&gt;Vesternet&lt;/a&gt; so I'm going to take a ook at that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I'm reading &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(comics)"&gt;The Finder Library&lt;/a&gt; and enjoying the sun while it lasts. The cats are making various sorties into the rest of the house and being hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very last of the work on the house drags oooooon. Today, an electrician does a number of small jobs, which sorts that out (and turns the tiny pointless room containing the entrance to the attic into a decent comms room). Tomorrow (hopefully) a plumber gets to drain and rebalance my radiators in order to fix a tiny drip from one of the radiator valves. The CCTV also gets finished off either today or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I am an awful lot more moved-in than I was.

&lt;p&gt;If you ever want to get funny looks in an electronics shop, break out a measuring tape and start measuring microwaves. I got an incredulous "They're all standard sizes" today in Power City, while standing in front of a load of microwaves that were clearly Very Different Sizes. Our old microwave (which I actually saw on sale for an eye-watering amount) is too big for the fancy flippy arrangement in the new kitchen, so I got one that physically fits, and performs the one function of a microwave I've ever used ("Nuke on full power for N minutes"). The old microwave was also a browner, grill, and worryingly had a button marked 'Chaos Defrost'. So it gets flogged/donated/something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also today was the &lt;a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Building/BER/"&gt;BER&lt;/a&gt; assessor looking at the house post-renovations. His only on-the-spot recommandations were something like "Eh, there are still one or two bulbs that aren't CFLs, and that's about it". So that's good. This assesment means free gubmint money to cover some small part of the heating/insulation work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was planning on tomorrow being a day off, but the solar installers never showed today, and some furniture is arriving tomorrow, as I found out today (2 weeks early!). Maybe I'll gt the weekend off?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category></entry><entry><title>July 16th 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/july-16th-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-17T09:35:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-07-17T09:35:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-07-17:/july-16th-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20140716-damacy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Why do I own this?!" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20140716-damacy.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was probably most of the day. That, and being asleep. I've found that between one thing and another, I'm still having to get up in the morning. This is, as they say, not what I signed up for. Going to have to sort that one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening saw some &lt;a href="http://www.irishairsoft.ie/"&gt;shooting of people&lt;/a&gt;, and then to bed for a delightful 5 hour nap, in time for getting up for the last of the builders (turning on the solar system, and the BER assessment).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category></entry><entry><title>July 15th 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/july-15th-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-15T21:48:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-07-15T21:48:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-07-15:/july-15th-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20140715-bed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bed!" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20140715-bed.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today turned out a good bit more productive than expected.

&lt;p&gt;This evening is my first night spent sleeping in the new house. I have to say it feels a bit strange not to be surrounded by other people in houses attached to mine. Getting used to the noises of a new house, the random settling and banging noises throughout, the outside noises seeping in. Compared to the house in Clane, it's deathly quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I'm actually not sure what's on the cards. I've been asked to do some driving instruction, and will be going &lt;a href="http://www.irishairsoft.ie/"&gt;shooting people&lt;/a&gt; in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also need to book some training. Check out what I bought in Newry:&lt;/p&gt;

Aside from that I played a bunch of &lt;a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, which I'm not sure I like yet, and moved a few small bits from house to house.

&lt;p&gt;As old-house starts looking less like a house, new-house starts looking like a way better house than old-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I bought new glasses, discovered that my prescription hasn't changed in 3 years (which I think is good), and then unpacked some nice chairs and a table we ordered a while back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect tomorrow may be a mostly-day-off. I need to get back on the bike again, and this weekend has been hectic.

&lt;p&gt;Busy day yesterday (and less busy today) so catching up today. The large furniture parts are moved, and some other stuff was delivered (this is a table and chairs).

Lead times on furniture are up to a month or so, so this'll keep happening over the next while. I was able to get a little bit done, but these are mostly still boxes in a corridor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, headed into Swords to a birthday thing for an Airsoft-buddy. I'm not usually a pub person, because I usually have a work or driving excuse, but I figured that this is the closest to a complete absence of an excuse I'll have, so I actually showed up. The plan was to be dirty stopouts, then up in the morning for some shoot shoots. That worked out delightfully, followed by some helping J and Oli move, followed by crashing on their spare bed for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home now, and having to face the terrifying prospect of an evening without television (it's still here, but I'm not arsed plugging it in). Tomorrow, there are some new-house bits to do, and some more J/Oli moving (their old place is close to Croker, so we have to wait for the bogger concentration to die down in the evening).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category></entry><entry><title>July 10th 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/july-10th-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-10T23:57:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-07-10T23:57:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-07-10:/july-10th-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20140710-arbit.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Arbit" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20140710-arbit.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd Van Day, and the old house is even barer. This will probably be my last sleep there. The cats get to stay here a while longer, until I have some painting and DIY and other non-cat-friendly stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new house has what we assume is a colony of wild rabbits nearby, we usually scatter one or two whenever we walk around the back. They came in handy today when we left out some cuttings from a tree in the front, which they duly disposed of by nibbling and running around nervously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I get solar panels turned on, and get to make a lot of phone calls (one of which will be about my being largely unable to make mobile phone calls in the new house.

&lt;p&gt;Later, headed up to Bellurgan for a site walkaround and meeting about a large &lt;a href="http://www.irishairsoft.ie"&gt;Airsoft&lt;/a&gt; game, &lt;a href="http://www.troops-in-contact.com/"&gt;The Rionegro Insurgency&lt;/a&gt;, I'm helping with running next month. Five weeks to go, and surely more about this as the time gets nearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep time.

&lt;p&gt;After a slight hiccup on the home stretch (a plumber having a go at drilling a hole in a ceramic sink, and succeeding against all odds), the house buildings works are done, finished, kaputt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipped a day, yesterday being mostly lost to what I'm assuming were sinus headaches, but which could have been stress or tiredness or a combination of both.

&lt;p&gt;Skipped a day, yesterday being mostly lost to what I'm assuming were sinus headaches, but which could have been stress or tiredness or a combination of both. Last time I bought a house, I ended up on a treadmill in a local clinic having some heart palpitations checked out. So things are going pretty well, considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was Kitchen day, the installers arriving first thing (as well as the Alarm guy, so now my alarm will send me a frantic SMS message if it goes off). After only slight mishaps (the hole in the ceiling for the extractor fan was measured based off old plans, so was a bit off. Whoops) I now have some of a kitchen. The main bits (sink, hob, oven) will go in hopefully tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had new washer and drier delivered, and got to hear an entertaining rant from the delivery guy (apparently 'Robertstown' is some vague amalgam of a couple of townlands that can mean any where from just outside Naas to Enfield, so about 30 square km). A happy throwback to living in town is that I'm able to give directions to my house via well-known local pubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also primed/sealed some plaster reveals in the rooms I didn't have profesionally painted, and hung some curtain rails. Aren't I a clever primate. I also now own a spirit level you could beat someone to death with (which, in fairness, is a critical criterion for any hand tool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, since the actual tradespeople don't arrive until the evening, I'm going to take a day off house stuff. I actually haven't had a proper lie-in since my leave started, so I'm going to try that, then see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="log"></category></entry><entry><title>June 29th 2014</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/june-29th-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-29T20:13:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-06-29T20:13:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-06-29:/june-29th-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My capacity to think of a witty title for every day is going to run dry eventully, so let's try this for a title convention -- protip: posts with the date as a title probably either have limited re-sale value or were boring in the first place :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I went and played some Airsoft, then met J in &lt;a href="http://www.ikea.ie/"&gt;IKEA&lt;/a&gt; and picked up a few small bits (no furniture yet, or at all from IKEA if I get my way), then headed home via seeing the new floor. This was the last unfinished surface in the house, the walls and ceilings having been finished yesterday post-windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was a big floor (spanning two rooms), we decided to go fairly swish, and weren't disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some zealous schwag-merchant deep in the innards of The Company was a month early with this -- probably giving me some time to mount it over the mantel of my plush leather and mahogony office before the big day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I'll not be in work for the big day -- I'm taking all of July and August off, so generally chill out, catch up on being lazy, and have more than 2 weeks off for the first time in my working life. I figure after 15 years or so I'm probably overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, my list of things to do for the two months amount to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move into new house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent out old house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ride my bike a bunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe get a new hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a solid set of objectives. I have vague plans to write more code, play more music, replay some games I've been meaning to. Anything after that seems like overachieving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this week saw lots of mail show up at the office, some of which is being squirreled away for hacking on later. Today, the &lt;a href="http://www.spark.io/"&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt; board arrived, which will be fun, if I decide what to do with it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of being able to talk over the network to stuff that's not supposed to is fascinating (which is why I've also picked up some z-wave toys for the new house, which I'll get to).

&lt;p&gt;The general idea is that if I've got nothing to write about every day or two, then I should probably be doing more stuff. I've put off a lot of things over the years, I should at least clear some things (I haven't made a list intentionally - that kind of invites disappointment, I think).&lt;/p&gt;

-- the short version is that it worked, although I didn't get to use it
'in anger' as such. The other thing I learned is that when traveling
through UK customs on the week of a royal wedding, having a small
plastic box with wires coming out of it and a 9v battery strapped to it
with tape is not a clever thing to have in your car (thankfully the
customs official had a sense of humour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I've been doing a bunch of for-money work, and only took time
out this week to relax. I occasionally take a week off to hang around at
home and get 'life administrivia' done. Think of it as a concrete block
on the see-saw of work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been playing around a bit with generalised messaging for
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation"&gt;domotics&lt;/a&gt; updates. I'm thinking of a centralised controller that can
accept events from various signals, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.currentcost.com/"&gt;Current Cost&lt;/a&gt; meter,
a wifi device coming in range, or a small IC hanging off the doorbell
circuit, for example. A lot of these devices don't have particularly
fully-functional network stacks, so I'll have to bite the bullet and get
the handful of ZigBee radios I got recently working. Doorbell will be
the fun one, I think. My house already has a (private) twitter account,
and DMs me for various stuff (unknown hosts grabbing a DHCP lease on the
network, etc.). Adding more stuff to this is the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also interested in the idea of cloud applications with local storage
or local encryption keys -- so all your data is stored encrypted on the
server side, and only you have the keys, so the content is decrypted at
render-time. Stuff like &lt;a href="http://agilebits.com/onepassword"&gt;1password&lt;/a&gt; does this with secure stuff like
password databases, but I think web browsing machines are zippy enough
to do this for userdata. I have to see if it's been done already (it
probably has), but I want to do some fiddling with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, same old.

people in a bunch of offices. They're not all in the states, but
Mountain View and Irvine are two offices in California I do go to
occasionally. When I was planning a trip to both late last year, I said
I'd look at alternatives to flying for an hour (SFO-&gt;SNA). After doing
some digging, I found the &lt;a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=AM_Route_C&amp;amp;pagename=am%2FLayout&amp;amp;cid=1241245648567"&gt;Coast Starlight&lt;/a&gt;, which is an &lt;a href="http://www.amtrak.com/"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt;
train that goes from Seattle to Los Angeles, and stops in Oakland and
San Jose. It so happens Oakland is a short &lt;a href="http://www.bart.gov/"&gt;BART&lt;/a&gt; ride from SFO, so I
said I'd give it a go.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TXQsjOuup4I/AAAAAAAADYE/egyd_N2BO6A/s720/P1010044.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly am ambivalent about the TSA, and being groped and
what-have-you. I realise there's no point in getting angry in Airports,
because the people there are just trying to make a living. I'm also
ambivalent about saving on flying (the plane goes whether I'm on it or
not). I just like trains, and this one promised 12 hours or so of good
geography and comfort. I got myself a '&lt;a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=AM_Accommodation_C&amp;amp;pagename=am%2FLayout&amp;amp;p=1237405732517&amp;amp;cid=1241210576173"&gt;roomette&lt;/a&gt;', which is
apparently what you're allowed call a small cupboard with a seat in it,
and it turned out to cost about \$130, which is cheaper than some air
fares SFO-&gt;SNA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also doesn't help that SNA is referred to in muttered tones as
'Disneyland Airport'. It's right beside Anaheim and the home of The
Mouse, so it's usually packed with kids. The look on a co-worker's face
when they called for people-who-need-extra-time-or-have-small-children,
and half the airport marched onto the plane will stay with me always.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TXQsiAKBXyI/AAAAAAAADbY/dObrAJqlKRg/s720/P1010042.JPG"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train itself is good and comfy. Tea, coffee, juice on each sleeper
carriage, and a bar and observation carriage which is decent for hanging
out, and "has" "wi-fi" (said wi-fi could well have been using the train
driver's 3G phone as an uplink, and meets the minimum federal
requirement to be called 'wi-fi'). The food is/was reasonably decent,
and some of the views are very pleasant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TXQsmIOW4OI/AAAAAAAADas/8eTLVJvyp7w/s720/P1010038.JPG"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 hours is a bit of a hike, so it's not recommended if you have actual
places to go, but it's miles more pleasant than the solid 4 hours or so
of wangling door-to-door it'd take to fly, and also trains kick ass.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in LA for the night, and continuing by train to Irvine tomorrow,
where I will again endure the hilarity of having to rent a car to cross
the road from my hotel to the office.

Kimberley/Mikado/Coconut Cream combination has stood the test.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm flying off to the Bay area for a few weeks to issue barked
instructions to nerds. I have a few posts lined up about the electronics
stuff I'm doing, but they can be spread out over the next few weeks so I
can resume when I get back. Inventing is interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'm writing this from the Delta Sky Club in JFK, which gets a solid meh
out of ten. The normal-person waiting area has iPads).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="imported"></category><category term="bunratty"></category><category term="chickens"></category><category term="castles"></category><category term="dromoland"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="update"></category></entry><entry><title>Hibernating</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/hibernating.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-24T13:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-11-24T13:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Conno</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2010-11-24:/hibernating.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;'Tis the season, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more stint of travel before the long and well-anticipated 2 weeks
off work for xmas. I've only had one unbroken year in the streak of
taking these 2 weeks off before in my entire working life -- I get very
grumpy if it doesn't work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks have been progressively colder at home, so the
heating has been bumped up a notch and the &lt;a href="http://www.theslanket.com/"&gt;Slanket&lt;/a&gt; has been seeing
more and more use. That tiny roundy cat you see above is also starting
to disappear under the duvet for the day when I'm out. Outside, it's got
that damp, crisp thing going on. I think I've gotten back to liking this
time of year. The last few have been not so good, for reasons I got
basically sorted out this year, so in a way I feel like I'm missing
something by going away (that and Favourite Lady, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a little more Airsoft, when I can. You tend to only
really get the serious players out these days, so it's a little less
annoying. I've also gotten my ticket to &lt;a href="http://www.berget-events.com/"&gt;Berget&lt;/a&gt; for next year. I
didn't go last year because I bought into the lame idea that I have to
bring an entire squad, but I think I'd like to head along even with one
or two people I know this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been progressively more involving. I've been getting a lot more
code done recently, and am trying to find a balance between
direction-setting and getting-hands-dirty for the project. I'm
encouraged to find I still like getting my hands dirty, but there's
always last-minute phone calls to encourage people designing software to
not pull the theoretical hot saucepan down on top of themselves which
impinges on Make Time, as we're to call it these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been looking again at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation"&gt;Domotics&lt;/a&gt; -- I've picked up a Scooba,
a few Roombas, and am looking at lawn and garden automation for next
year. I'll do a proper post on this at some point. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Things-Talk-Practical-Connecting/dp/0596510519/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1290604399&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Making Things
Talk&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating read so far, it may be the first paper book I
bring on a plane in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I'm off to California on Sunday. I'm spending a week
with the Analytics development team (I manage the Analytics Frontend SRE
team), and then am in Seattle for 3 days with the Analytics Backend SRE
team. It's my first Mountain View visit in a good long while, almost a
year in fact. It'll be good to see videoconference peeps for realsies
for a change.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="imported"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="me"></category><category term="november"></category><category term="update"></category><category term="winter"></category></entry><entry><title>Barcelona</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/barcelona.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-15T16:04:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-11-15T16:04:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2010-11-15:/barcelona.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sagrada Familia has scrubbed up nice, hasn't it?

week, as he came along to consecrate it (they need a level 11
god-botherer to consecrate something this bug, since he's high enough
level to know the spell, and can only cast it once a day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barcelona is still nice. People use the city, which is a far cry from
anything I've seen in Dublin (Dublin has character, but that character
needs a few auld shcoops to loosen itself up and usually finds a way to
wreck anything out of the ordinary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November is also a reasonable time to go. It was t-shirt weather
throughout, except for the top of the tourist bus. We didn't get enough
time to do all the touristy bits, but got some successful shopping done
and felt like it was a weekend well-spent nonetheless. We'll probably be
back.&lt;/p&gt;

after Tel Aviv. Even though it's pretty much a regular week, catching up
my brain from all the stuff I promised to do, and getting back into the
stuff I was doing when I left had just about happened by today,
basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently looking into full-spectrum/white lighting, for home and
work. November is usually a bad brain month, in general. This year, I've
been continuing my theme of doing things pro-actively by attempting to
spend at least some of it outside the country (I'll be in Barcelona next
week, and heading to California at the end of the month), and the
aforementioned lighting. I can recommend &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;search-type=ss&amp;amp;index=kitchen-uk&amp;amp;field-keywords=Androv"&gt;Androv&lt;/a&gt; for cheap bulbs --
their 'dimmable' bulb makes a bold claim I've been unable to reproduce,
but their other stuff is good, and cheap. It makes a discernable
difference to overall mood if I'm working under one for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one bad thing, of course (and the reasons why hotels use low-light
yellow bulbs) is that it shows up every speck of dirt and dust in the
room. Once you can deal with this, I heartily endorse this event or
product. You feel less like you're holed up in a fortress of solitude,
and brighter lights (properly shaded) are in general good for your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing other brain stuff recently, which I'll get into. The
moral: making your brain work is damn useful if it's what pays your
bills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="imported"></category><category term="brain"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="me"></category><category term="november"></category></entry><entry><title>Tel Aviv</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/tel-aviv.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-25T13:19:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-10-25T13:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2010-10-25:/tel-aviv.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm spending this week in Israel, in The Company's Tel Aviv

&lt;p&gt;Tel Aviv beats my record for "Furthest east on a traditional world map",
the previous record held by Dubrovnik. I don't get to do a lot of
touristing this time, but they're at least threatening to bring me to
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea"&gt;Caesarea&lt;/a&gt; later in the week. I also get to possibly walk around and
see Jaffa/Yafo on friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of travel recently, most recently to Seattle
(again) and Italy. Was also going to be going to Lisbon, but got my
annual dose of brain mush right before. I'm heading to Tel Aviv next
week, Barcelona with a Nice Lady in November, and Seattle in November
too. I'm personally responsible for &lt;a href="http://outsidetheinterzone.blogspot.com/2009/09/mother-nature.html"&gt;crying icebergs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

let's just say I'd like to. I'm feeling a little more like I'd like to
remember some of this stuff, and we won't have USA assorted biscuit tins
full of B&amp;amp;W negatives in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Log"></category><category term="imported"></category><category term="me"></category><category term="revival"></category><category term="update"></category></entry></feed>
