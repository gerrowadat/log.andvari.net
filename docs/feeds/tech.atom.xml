&lt;p&gt;This is the aeroplane survival kit. I don't sleep on planes, and Aer Lingus have transatlantic WiFi now, so this is indispensble. That's the work phone (Nexus 4), work tablet (Nexus 10), and the newly-acquired Moto 360 smartwatch, which the jury is still out on (pretty shiny so far though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three other pieces of indisensible kit are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I'll get some stuff done on the plane - I've yet to properly emulate the distraction-deprivation environment that planes give you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, edit /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be an @gmail account,
it can be a GAFYD account, once you've logged into it once to activate
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then just generate the map file for the
sasl_passwd file and reload. As root:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;postmap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sasl_passwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;postfix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you're done. Monitor your queue a few
times over the first few days to make sure stupid stuff hasn't happened
(the delay between mails might get tweaked), but in general this has
worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

(mainly a combination of work things and family things kicking my ass),
but I got to some of it tonight -- The clever parts of the design and
build are basically done, so what's left is producing the final piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the motion sensor parts, there's also the bright light, to
mess with people's night vision. For this, I got 4 super-bright LEDs,
and did monstrous things with solder to produce a 5x2 header, that was
fully connected along the long side. This gave me the 4 LEDs connected
in parallell. This is pretty bright with the 5v applied from the analog
output of the Arduino:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result will be built on an Arduno Fio board, which only has a
3.3v signal (It's powered off a 3.7v LiPo battery), so I'll need to
amplify that somehow. I'm thinking I might try to power the board and
LEDs off a regular 9V instead, or have the LiPo powering the board and
the 9V powering the buzzer and leds, gated on the signal line of the
board with some transistors. I may be of course talking out my ass. I'm
going to pick up some various transistors over the weekend and
experimenting. My guess is the gate and emitter of a transistor need a
common ground, which won't work with using separate power sources. We'll
see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, deadlines, help. I'm supposed to be using this thing next
saturday.

specific kind, there are a few other kinds, but they should have
datasheets. You might recognise the bulbous white shape of them from
those motion-sensing light switches. They're about a fiver each and fun
to play with.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments section on Sparkfun had a &lt;a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/sensors/Reports/PIRMotionSensor"&gt;very good tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on basic
use, but also explains the basic principles of its operation. It has 3
pins -- DC, Ground and Alarm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Science Bit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alarm pin is what's called an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collector"&gt;Open Collector&lt;/a&gt;, which means it's
either connected to ground, or to 'nothing'. To better understand this,
let's assume you don't know what a transistor is (I know I sure didn't a
few weeks ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking simplistically, a transistor is a component where you can vary
one voltage based on a much smaller voltage. In this way you can amplify
a voltage pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a diagram!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Transistor2.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually transistors are tiny and embedded or are tiny and on a
breadboard, but let's assume for a moment that it's a box with 3 wires
coming out of it. They're called collector, emitter and base. Emitter is
always connected to ground, and provides the reference voltage, or
definition of 'zero'. Base is a small voltage in relation to ground, and
the voltage applied to the base controls how much voltage is allowed
flow between the emitter and the collector. The difference between the
voltage on the base, and the voltage allowed through the collector is
called the 'gain'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However! The voltage on the collector doesn't come from nowhere. It has
to be supplied, and the voltage 'allowed' to flow is defined by the
voltage on the base. So, if you apply 3.3v to the base, and 9v to the
collector (the voltage marked 'V~cc~' on the diagram there), you get a
certain voltage that's actually 'allowed' through the transistor, and
can be used in other applications by connecting them before the resistor
(At 'V~out~' on the diagram).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zig-zaggy thing there on the diagram is a resistor. We put it across
the larger V~cc~ voltage to lower it a bit, since transistors are
usually only rated to take a certain voltage. The function of V~cc~ and
the resistor is to 'pull up' the voltage across the emitter and
collector. This is why the resistor there is often called a 'pull-up
resistor'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transistors are handy for switches when you want to control a large
voltage using a small voltage. They're also useful if you want to take a
tiny voltage you get from a signal somewhere and amplify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, why this is relevant is that an 'Open Collector' is the
collector from a transistor that's available as a signal. However,
instead of usual 'binary' signals that might produce a 'True' voltage or
a 'False' lack of voltage, it's either connected to ground, or not.
Whether or not it is connected to ground depends on the base voltage. My
guess is that the PIR sensor circuitry provides the 'base' voltage and
lets us use any V~cc~ voltage we want, in order to 'pull up' the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you go look at the circuit diagram and build instructions in the
tutorial mentioned above, it works just so. The one modification I made
here is that as well as pulling up the voltage, instead of connecting
back to the LED on the Arduino board, I connected up to a big old Piezo
Buzzer I got in Maplin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finished build looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TY0Nl6RxURI/AAAAAAAADfk/kPBdY2IPIUQ/s720/IMG_20110313_212116.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the end result is that when you wave your hand in front of the PIR,
the buzzer makes an annoying noise. Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up would be making things a bit smaller -- There are smaller,
cheaper Arduino boards you can get, and I'll do a build soon that's a
little easier to get into a project box and lug around with you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="imported"></category><category term="arduino"></category><category term="electronics"></category></entry><entry><title>Electronics Schwag (The Specifics)</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/electronics-schwag-the-specifics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-02T06:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2011-03-02T06:24:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2011-03-02:/electronics-schwag-the-specifics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A commenter asked me for more specifics on stuff to get when getting

here's my uninformed opinion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Soldering Iron&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a good one. I got a reasonably crap Draper one from Amazon, which
was 25W. It's fine, but takes a while to heat up and can be a little
while melting the solder, which is annoying when you're holding
everything just-so and it's all perfect except the hot bit isn't hot
enough. If I were doing this again I'd get a 40w one, and one with
adjustable heat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the soldering tutorials I've seen use a pointed tip on the
soldering iron. I've found the chisel tip a lot easier. I can touch the
tip against a solder point and heat the wire and contact a lot easier
than using a pointed tip (which you don't use the point of anyway). I'd
recommend you try both to see what works.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of the online tutorials say "Don't use silver solder or lead-free
solder, it's a pain in the ass to use". Well, thanks to RoHs, lead
solder is at least very hard (if not impossible) to get in Europe. &lt;a href="http://www.rohsusa.com/"&gt;This
crackpot here&lt;/a&gt; has a website talking about it, but you're probably
wasting your time looking for lead solder in Ireland. I found it easy
enough to solder with lead-free, but then again I've no frame of
reference. I just picked up some 60/40 and 63/37 lead solder here in the
bay area, so we'll see once I'm back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People make a big deal about lead-free solder not being less dangerous
than lead solder. All I know is that if you're burning a solid
metal-looking object and smoke comes out, breathing it in is probably
bad for you. Little pro tip there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wire Strippers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See this here, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3YD7B3n0I/AAAAAAAADTs/8_rFTwY-Mwo/stripper.jpg?imgmax=800"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load of shite. Avoid like the plague. I wasn't able to adjust mine to
strip the wire I got, and it just chomped ineffectually and was big and
annoying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now see this?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3YmDWsgsI/AAAAAAAADTw/9xsBSVLpsW4/wire_stripper.jpg?imgmax=800"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bog standard wire stripper, costs a fiver or less, is in pretty much
every electronics set ever. That is because it's the only wire stripper
you'll ever need. Some wire stripper inventor guy is using money to
insulate his attic because of these babies, because they're great. Get
one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wires&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking about wire strippers, of course, I should let you know
that stripping the ends off wires is for suckers. I picked up a &lt;a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/jump-wire-kit-2014"&gt;Jump
Wire Kit&lt;/a&gt; in Maplin in town, which has a bunch of varying lengths of
wire, especially for breadboarding and the like. I also recommend &lt;a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=386"&gt;this
set of jumper wires&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/"&gt;SK Pang&lt;/a&gt;, which are even neater (and
cheaper!). For the first while you're probably not going to be soldering
wires in place, so the jump wires are grand.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breadboards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breadboards are boards full of holes you stick wires into. If you're
getting one, make sure to get one with a power rail going along each
side, which are much nicer. It should look something like this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3bULTgKtI/AAAAAAAADT8/xmi4aUL24N4/halfbb.jpg?imgmax=800"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get two or three so you don't have to dismantle something you're doing
to re-use the breadboard.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Arduino Stuff and Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main Arduino stuff you want to pick up, barring any particular
project in mind, is one or two (they're small and cheap) boards, the USB
cable you need to talk to them, and some breadboards for fiddling
around.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board you want to get is the Uno, and you may want to avoid the SMD
edition if you can. For a lot of stuff, it won't matter, but the main
difference is you can't remove the microcontroller chip from the SMD
version. There are reasons you may want to do this, which I'll cover in
a later post. The SMD version was mainly produced due to a worldwide
shortage of the Atmega328 chip in the larger removable form factor, so
you're more than likely getting the non-SMD, but it probably doesn't
make a difference. The SMD version apparently has other improvements for
meganerds who want to fiddle with the firmware on the board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the normal version with the microcontroller chip in a socket on
the board:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3hp1B4RxI/AAAAAAAADUQ/x2GXJJJel60/uno.jpg?imgmax=800"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the SMD version, notice the tiny surface-mount chip. Same chip,
different form factor. Notice the 6 extra pins near the USB port.
Apparently you can do science with them:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3h007Q7iI/AAAAAAAADUU/UsjCS2qlfYg/unosmd.jpg?imgmax=800"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also look into getting 'shields' for the board, which are
basically other boards that plug into the Uno. They're good for
prototyping, but can be bigger than what you want when you want to
shrink things down. You can get them for stuff like ethernet, XBee (mesh
networking), and other kinds of wired or wireless comms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend getting one of the starter kits, the one from &lt;a href="http://www.adafruit.com/"&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt;
is good, comes with everything you need. I also recommend getting a
Proto Shield, which is a good starter soldering project. The Adafruit
starter kit comes with one, and &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/"&gt;SparkFun&lt;/a&gt; do a different one that
does roughly the same thing. While you're getting stuff, have a look
around &lt;a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/"&gt;SK Pang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.adafruit.com/"&gt;AdaFruit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/"&gt;SparkFun&lt;/a&gt; to see what
they've got, there are a bunch of ready-made projects and widgets
that'll give you ideas for projects. Personally, I picked up some
&lt;a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~leah/LilyPad/"&gt;LilyPad&lt;/a&gt; stuff for the project I dreamed up (details coming soon) and
an RFID reader chip and breakout board for fiddling with RFID.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more specialised stuff, there are smaller boards you can get, which
end up cheaper than the Uno. The &lt;a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=140_141&amp;amp;products_id=445"&gt;Pro Mini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=140_141&amp;amp;products_id=325"&gt;FIO&lt;/a&gt; end up a fiver
or so cheaper per board, and can be good if you have specific things in
mind (I picked up a pair of FIOs, since they have an XBee socket
onboard).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As components go, Maplin do 'lucky bags' of the likes of resistors,
capacitors, etc. If you know exactly what you want, &lt;a href="http://rswww.ie/"&gt;Radionics&lt;/a&gt; have a
large catalogue and do next-day courier delivery in Dublin for a fiver.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up I'll be talking about the project I've been thinking about, and
the bits I've been gradually accumulating for it. I'll also show you the
first few photos I have of my own tinkerings with RFID reading.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="imported"></category><category term="arduino"></category><category term="electronics"></category><category term="tech"></category></entry><entry><title>Legbone connected to my Wristwatch</title><link href="https://log.andvari.net/legbone-connected-to-my-wristwatch.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-17T16:49:00+00:00</published><updated>2011-02-17T16:49:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Dave O'Connor</name></author><id>tag:log.andvari.net,2011-02-17:/legbone-connected-to-my-wristwatch.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been fiddling about with small electronics recently, specifically

if you want fewer I/O ports or a specialised board layout you need to

&lt;p&gt;The hard part, I've found, is thinking of things to make. In the
meantime I'm practicing soldering, using projects like making a few
&lt;a href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=17_21&amp;amp;products_id=51"&gt;ProtoShields&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=17_21&amp;amp;products_id=286"&gt;LOLShield&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I made a functional RFID reader, using less than 50 euro
worth of parts, which for a long-time hardware luddite was extremely
fulfilling. I even managed to solder without burning myself or others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got one or two projects in mind, mainly around wireless sensors and

use cases (no, this has nothing to do with the iPad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's only after I started using a Nexus One with android that I realised
how shite the iPhone was in a lot of ways. Case in point: The one thing
that I wanted my phone to do wasn't implemented yet, so &lt;a href="http://uk.androlib.com/android.application.net-andvari-bluetoothcondition-AwCq.aspx"&gt;I did it&lt;/a&gt;.
The concept of doing that on iPhone without jumping through a ridiculous
number of hoops is alien to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another case in point happened this evening, or at least a symptom of
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd recently gotten a &lt;a href="http://www.soekris.com/net5501.htm"&gt;Soekris net5501&lt;/a&gt; to act as a home dhcp/dns/etc.
server, having gotten tired/bored of just letting the Airport extreme do
everything. I wanted to use DynDNS properly, and I wanted something I
could leave on when I go on business trips (So I can leave power usage
monitoring on, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a plan, right? So after fiddling with getting the Soekris
installed, I plugged everything in, set up ISC dhcpd and Bind, and then
went to Airport Utility to turn off DHCP on the Airport Extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, you can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't actually turn off DHCP, without putting the device into bridge
mode. You literally cannot run a NAT network using an Airport Extreme
where it's not the DHCP server for your LAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than ditching my Airport on some unsuspecting fanboy and doing
research to find a good 802.11n router, I just set a DHCP pool size of 1
and got on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this basically reinforced my increasingly negative opinion of
what Apple is up to these days. Apple products are increasingly not for
people who know what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer, I own an ipod and use a macbook pro as my only computer
for day-to-day use. They work fine, and are great products. Which makes
it a shame that a lot of their other stuff falls down so hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: here's how to get ISC dhcpd to ignore a certain MAC address if
you have a stupid device you want to talk to another dhcp server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stupidhost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;hardware&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ethernet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;deny&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;booting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
