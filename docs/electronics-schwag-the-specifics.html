      <p>A commenter asked me for more specifics on stuff to get when getting
started with electronics, so since I've learned a little since then,
here's my uninformed opinion.  </p>
<h3>Soldering Iron</h3>
<p>Get a good one. I got a reasonably crap Draper one from Amazon, which
was 25W. It's fine, but takes a while to heat up and can be a little
while melting the solder, which is annoying when you're holding
everything just-so and it's all perfect except the hot bit isn't hot
enough. If I were doing this again I'd get a 40w one, and one with
adjustable heat.  </p>
<p>A lot of the soldering tutorials I've seen use a pointed tip on the
soldering iron. I've found the chisel tip a lot easier. I can touch the
tip against a solder point and heat the wire and contact a lot easier
than using a pointed tip (which you don't use the point of anyway). I'd
recommend you try both to see what works.  </p>
<h3>Solder</h3>
<p>Lots of the online tutorials say "Don't use silver solder or lead-free
solder, it's a pain in the ass to use". Well, thanks to RoHs, lead
solder is at least very hard (if not impossible) to get in Europe. <a href="http://www.rohsusa.com/">This
crackpot here</a> has a website talking about it, but you're probably
wasting your time looking for lead solder in Ireland. I found it easy
enough to solder with lead-free, but then again I've no frame of
reference. I just picked up some 60/40 and 63/37 lead solder here in the
bay area, so we'll see once I'm back.  </p>
<p>People make a big deal about lead-free solder not being less dangerous
than lead solder. All I know is that if you're burning a solid
metal-looking object and smoke comes out, breathing it in is probably
bad for you. Little pro tip there.  </p>
<h3>Wire Strippers</h3>
<p>See this here, right?  </p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3YD7B3n0I/AAAAAAAADTs/8_rFTwY-Mwo/stripper.jpg?imgmax=800"></p>
<p>Load of shite. Avoid like the plague. I wasn't able to adjust mine to
strip the wire I got, and it just chomped ineffectually and was big and
annoying.  </p>
<p>Okay, now see this?  </p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3YmDWsgsI/AAAAAAAADTw/9xsBSVLpsW4/wire_stripper.jpg?imgmax=800"></p>
<p>Bog standard wire stripper, costs a fiver or less, is in pretty much
every electronics set ever. That is because it's the only wire stripper
you'll ever need. Some wire stripper inventor guy is using money to
insulate his attic because of these babies, because they're great. Get
one.  </p>
<h3>Wires</h3>
<p>After talking about wire strippers, of course, I should let you know
that stripping the ends off wires is for suckers. I picked up a <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/jump-wire-kit-2014">Jump
Wire Kit</a> in Maplin in town, which has a bunch of varying lengths of
wire, especially for breadboarding and the like. I also recommend <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=386">this
set of jumper wires</a> from <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/">SK Pang</a>, which are even neater (and
cheaper!). For the first while you're probably not going to be soldering
wires in place, so the jump wires are grand.  </p>
<h3>Breadboards</h3>
<p>Breadboards are boards full of holes you stick wires into. If you're
getting one, make sure to get one with a power rail going along each
side, which are much nicer. It should look something like this:  </p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3bULTgKtI/AAAAAAAADT8/xmi4aUL24N4/halfbb.jpg?imgmax=800"></p>
<p>Get two or three so you don't have to dismantle something you're doing
to re-use the breadboard.  </p>
<h3>Arduino Stuff and Components</h3>
<p>The main Arduino stuff you want to pick up, barring any particular
project in mind, is one or two (they're small and cheap) boards, the USB
cable you need to talk to them, and some breadboards for fiddling
around.   </p>
<p>The board you want to get is the Uno, and you may want to avoid the SMD
edition if you can. For a lot of stuff, it won't matter, but the main
difference is you can't remove the microcontroller chip from the SMD
version. There are reasons you may want to do this, which I'll cover in
a later post. The SMD version was mainly produced due to a worldwide
shortage of the Atmega328 chip in the larger removable form factor, so
you're more than likely getting the non-SMD, but it probably doesn't
make a difference. The SMD version apparently has other improvements for
meganerds who want to fiddle with the firmware on the board.  </p>
<p>This is the normal version with the microcontroller chip in a socket on
the board:  </p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3hp1B4RxI/AAAAAAAADUQ/x2GXJJJel60/uno.jpg?imgmax=800"></p>
<p>This is the SMD version, notice the tiny surface-mount chip. Same chip,
different form factor. Notice the 6 extra pins near the USB port.
Apparently you can do science with them:  </p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_otzZMGWrd00/TW3h007Q7iI/AAAAAAAADUU/UsjCS2qlfYg/unosmd.jpg?imgmax=800"></p>
<p>You might also look into getting 'shields' for the board, which are
basically other boards that plug into the Uno. They're good for
prototyping, but can be bigger than what you want when you want to
shrink things down. You can get them for stuff like ethernet, XBee (mesh
networking), and other kinds of wired or wireless comms.  </p>
<p>I recommend getting one of the starter kits, the one from <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>
is good, comes with everything you need. I also recommend getting a
Proto Shield, which is a good starter soldering project. The Adafruit
starter kit comes with one, and <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">SparkFun</a> do a different one that
does roughly the same thing. While you're getting stuff, have a look
around <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/">SK Pang</a>, <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">AdaFruit</a> and <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">SparkFun</a> to see what
they've got, there are a bunch of ready-made projects and widgets
that'll give you ideas for projects. Personally, I picked up some
<a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~leah/LilyPad/">LilyPad</a> stuff for the project I dreamed up (details coming soon) and
an RFID reader chip and breakout board for fiddling with RFID.  </p>
<p>For more specialised stuff, there are smaller boards you can get, which
end up cheaper than the Uno. The <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=140_141&amp;products_id=445">Pro Mini</a> and <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=140_141&amp;products_id=325">FIO</a> end up a fiver
or so cheaper per board, and can be good if you have specific things in
mind (I picked up a pair of FIOs, since they have an XBee socket
onboard).  </p>
<p>As components go, Maplin do 'lucky bags' of the likes of resistors,
capacitors, etc. If you know exactly what you want, <a href="http://rswww.ie/">Radionics</a> have a
large catalogue and do next-day courier delivery in Dublin for a fiver.  </p>
<h3>Next Up</h3>
<p>Next up I'll be talking about the project I've been thinking about, and
the bits I've been gradually accumulating for it. I'll also show you the
first few photos I have of my own tinkerings with RFID reading.  </p>
