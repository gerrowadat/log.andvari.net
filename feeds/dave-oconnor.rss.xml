&lt;p&gt;Communicating with your team scales up as your team grows - it's an experience not unlike the individual engineer to senior engineer to &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/"&gt;staff engineer&lt;/a&gt; path.

&lt;p&gt;Let's try every week or so? No excuses about no time :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, last week was my last week at Google. I'm writing this from the weird void of disbelief where I've not quite settled into the 6 or so

&lt;p&gt;I'm now most of the way through the ~month or so I took off work.

&lt;p&gt;My last attempt at doing the Home Automation/Domotics/Whatyacallit a few years back mostly involved buying expensive widgets, determining they are shite, or marketed at US power and outlets, and then discovering that setup and upgrades generally involved one ore more of downloading a random .exe from random websites …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave O'Connor</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 15:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:log.andvari.net,2020-12-31:/december-31-2020.html</guid><category>Log</category><category>log</category><category>tech</category></item><item><title>December 09 2020</title><link>https://log.andvari.net/december-09-2020.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20201209-brainwork.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20201209-brainwork.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've set both a really good example (take your vacation!) and a really bad example (Don't leave it all til the last minute!) for work folks, and therefore today was my last day at work in 2020. It's been a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather turns and turns. We're well into the season where things spring out, and make you cut them back,

&lt;p&gt;The weather's turning. It's one of those nice times of year when it's cold and mostly dry, but without a winter in front of us. Things are growing at home and we're seeing what pops up on our first spring in the new place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic weekend! The first week back at work was one of those stealth first-weeks-back, where the first part is relief that nothing exploded in my 3 weeks away, and the rest was EVERYTHING HAPPENING. But it's the weekend now, and Amazon has a fancy Karcher window vacuum on sale.

&lt;p&gt;So, every October or so, I ask HR at work for a report of people on my team (I have somehow tricked The Company, or they have tricked me, into being responsible for about 40 people) who haven't taken enough vacation, since we can only carry over 5 days.

&lt;p&gt;The last of this year's travel is ongoing. I haven't had a weekend in NYC in a while, and it's managed not to snow this time. A decent day yesterday walking around the park and times square in the rain, and visiting &lt;a href="https://www.moma.org/"&gt;MoMA&lt;/a&gt; for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent korean BBQ is a lot less cheaty than sausage and stodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hoped, got a bunch of stuff done on the plane, and managed to not have an awful flight.

&lt;p&gt;Off to Mountain View in the morning for 3 days, then onwards to New York. I haven't been to MTV since January, or NYC since June, so I guess I'm due in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the aeroplane survival kit.

&lt;p&gt;At a work conference in Munich, which I've never been to before. From what I have seen of restaurants here, it is a Paleo disaster, so I've been pretty cheat-y so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More inactivity! Mainly it's been ridiculously busy in work, mostly around performance reviews and a number of things sneaking up on me. They're sneaky, those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing a little more travel before the end of the year -- Munich, London, Mountain View and New York (twice). Yay.

&lt;p&gt;Trying to keep this thing up by doing worthwhile things. That was the idea, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying &lt;a href="https://thepaleodiet.com/"&gt;Paleo&lt;/a&gt; for the last few weeks, with a drop of about 1.1kg per week so far.

&lt;p&gt;Away in Zurich for a few days with work. Partially to meet a bunch of people, but also to get into the practice of being away from home in small doses. I've a few more trips coming up (London, Munich, etc) that'll also help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second week back, and seeing what my job ends up looking like for the next while. Think 'busy'. I'm trying to nail down travel until the end of the year, it being increasingly impossible. I'll be in Zurich for a while next week, and after that is anyone's guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First week back at work - done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have been more physically tiring than otherwise. I've been trying to nail down the next couple of months travel wise, and managed to make it into work on the bike 
two days out of five, which was good.

&lt;p&gt;Last day of leave, and a day of normalcy and domesticity. Mainly hung around and enjoyed the last of the days since the end of June, when I last went near work.

&lt;p&gt;Not a lot got done today, which is as it should be. Went for a wee motorcycle ride, which turned into a spin to, and around the phoenix park. Getting more confident and enjoying it more now that there are fewer moments of pant-shitting terror.

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this is the last of the work on the new house. Today, the painting of the exterior finished, the plumbing was finished inside, and the garage/shed got alarmed (we quickly calmed it down). Just in time for a week left in my time off work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep cycle being fucked up. That's the holiday sensation I know so well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week between updates, but it's been a reasonably busy one. Still moving a bunch of stuff from the old house, still trying to get out on the (motor)bike every day or so (in between impressive rainshowers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates getting more infrequent, so I should make it my business to do more interesting things, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thge last few days haven't felt like particularly urgent ones, which is good -- I think I'm winding down the urgency level overall, and the time off work is kicking in. I had originally intended to take a month off, and was convinced to take 2 by a co-worker.

&lt;p&gt;26 and 27 have been days off. I said before about needing to take 'days off' from the moving and the Stuff I Gotta Do - these days turned out that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday night, I got one of the annoying headaches I get if I get too tired or stressed, so …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dave O'Connor</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2014 23:12:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:log.andvari.net,2014-07-27:/july-27th-2014.html</guid><category>Log</category><category>log</category></item><item><title>July 25th 2014</title><link>https://log.andvari.net/july-25th-2014.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/20140725-stranger.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Duncare, skritches plz" src="/images/thumbs/thumbnail_square/20140725-stranger.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was Moving Day for small cats everywhere. As predicted, Stranger didn't care and just wanted her head scratched, and Ping stared bloody murder and found some hiding places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight was uneventful, aside from the CCTV making noises at 0330 and complaining about SMART errors.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, some dudes in a JCB showed up outside the gate to fill in a giant pothole that trucks and buses had been disappearing down for the last few months. It is my understanding that I should figure out who caused this to happen and then vote for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have moved, the cats have not. This means they get really needy when I'm in the old house. See above for an example: I sat down and Ping immediately sat on my arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever want to get funny looks in an electronics shop, break out a measuring tape and start measuring microwaves. I got an incredulous "They're all standard sizes" today in Power City, while standing in front of a load of microwaves that were clearly Very Different Sizes.

&lt;p&gt;I own a sealed copy of Katamari Damacy for the PS2. You find these things out when you're moving and doing a cull of crap. Why do I own this? I don't even own a PS2 any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today turned out a good bit more productive than expected.

&lt;p&gt;Eating an actual meal in what was essentially a building site a week or so ago is a strange experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As old-house starts looking less like a house, new-house starts looking like a way better house than old-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Busy day yesterday (and less busy today) so catching up today. The large furniture parts are moved, and some other stuff was delivered (this is a table and chairs).

&lt;p&gt;2nd Van Day, and the old house is even barer. This will probably be my last sleep there. The cats get to stay here a while longer, until I have some painting and DIY and other non-cat-friendly stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting to move. First, large furniture items, so rented another van from another place, and moved bed, TV stuff, various other bits.

&lt;p&gt;A simple day in one way. Helped J move cats and possessions, rented a van and negotiated extremely tiny streets with same. Only managed to knock the wing mirror off once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afternoon-food in &lt;a href="https://www.woodstockcafe.ie/"&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt;, which never disappoints. Om nom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another late morning. I am entitled. The only useful thing that happened today was painting one of the bedrooms. Tomorrow I get to drive a giant van around, helping J move to a new place.
