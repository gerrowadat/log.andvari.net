Updates getting more infrequent, so I should make it my business to do more interesting things, right?

Thursday and friday were the [IBT] course, which I passed, making me apparently eligible to ride a motorycle of any size without restriction, as long as I wear a newbie hi-vis. That seems kind of terrifying.

Yesterday, I picked up the rest of the bike gear/PPE, so all I'm missing now is a bike. And for this rain to feck off so it's safe to ride it.

This week looks like it's moving the rest of the stuff from the old house, and finding a rental agency that wants to turn the old house from a mess into paying tenants. Possibly interspersed with bike shopping, but there's no rush on that.
