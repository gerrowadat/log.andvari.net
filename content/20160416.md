Some of the gear that's being shipped to Czech Republic (or [Czechia](http://www.go-czechia.com/) if you don't please) for [Border War](http://www.borderwar.cz/) next week. I and 20-odd other tubby nerd militia follow it all next week. This will be my third time in as many years, and probably the unfittest I've been in about that time. Let's see if I manage to hold my own or expire (It's 3 days of camping and about 30-40km of hiking with a load of gear on you).

Thankfully, the weather looks to be clearing up and staying cleared up, which means a bunch of motorbike commuting (and gadding about). This is a good thing for the brains.
