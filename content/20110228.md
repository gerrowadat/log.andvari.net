Myself and Favourite Lady took the weekend off to head to [Dromoland]
(warning: terrible website will make all your orifices bleed rage). It
was nice to get out to that part of the country again. Roomservice
breakfast while reading the sunday papers is one of the best things
ever.  
  
We also had the opportunity to visit Bunratty Castle, which I'd last
visited as a tiny nipper when my dad used to bring school tours there.
We saw some chickens begging for scones.

Then we saw some of the old biscuits known to man. Shows how the old
Kimberley/Mikado/Coconut Cream combination has stood the test.

Today, I'm flying off to the Bay area for a few weeks to issue barked
instructions to nerds. I have a few posts lined up about the electronics
stuff I'm doing, but they can be spread out over the next few weeks so I
can resume when I get back. Inventing is interesting.  
  
(I'm writing this from the Delta Sky Club in JFK, which gets a solid meh
out of ten. The normal-person waiting area has iPads).
