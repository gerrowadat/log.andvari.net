Finally (I am a male Irish person, after all. We're allergic to health professionals) went to the Physio today for a niggling problem I've had with one of my calves for the last while. What I thought was a bit of stiffness due to lack of exercise and a need to HTFU is actually [Achilles Tendinitis], which is a lot more scientific of a diagnosis. Icepacks and stretches for a while. Just in time for wanting to use my calves a bunch, yay.

Also, figured out the last big renovation job on the house (a floor in two of the rooms). A good bit more than I was expecting to spend, but should be commensurately nicer. All things going well, we could be done by end of next week. Could be. All things going well. Yep.
