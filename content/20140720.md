I have moved, the cats have not. This means they get really needy when I'm in the old house. See above for an example: I sat down and Ping immediately sat on my arm.

House business: More furniture has arrived, the blinds and CCTV are being installed tomorrow (if people show up). Then the Cats may move, since all that's left is some electrical work.

Other business: Went to see "Monty Python Live (almost)" in VUE in Liffey Valley. Some nice touches added to the older bits, and they knew which bits to go Just Too Far on (and it was either abundantly clear that Cleese didn't want to be there, or he was putting it on really convincingly).
