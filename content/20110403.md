One year ago today, a very small ball of fur decided to mew outside our
front door in particular. We let her in and looked after her for a bit,
and eventually decided she could stay.

We're not sure exactly how old she is, we're guessing se was about 6-7
months when she came to us, but I guess her finding day is as good a day
as any to be happy she's around.

Happy finding day, Ping.
