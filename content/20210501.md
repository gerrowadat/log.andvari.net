One of my excuses for not updating this more often is the fiddly nature of making sure I have a working [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) install. I mean, the real reason is laziness, but that's a handy excuse.

"Woudn't it be great", my insomnia-brain said to itself, "If I could just check a markdown file into git and everything just happened?".

So, a bit of fiddling later, a combination of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) does just that. So, no more excuses, right?

The [repo](https://github.com/gerrowadat/log.andvari.net) will give you an idea of how to go about it if you feel like emulating. It still ticks my box of "I have the content in a form tht can be used to publish elsewhere if I want", so nerd brain is also happy.

Hopefully longer post incoming, I guess I have some news, right?
