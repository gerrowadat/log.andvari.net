Further to the [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w1y5m/we_are_the_google_site_reliability_engineering/cexy5sd) I was
involved in a few years back (I am /u/sre_pointyhair) - "The Guy" showed up at my desk last week. 

Alas, I was away, and he had to make do with doing the unspeakable things we do to keep servers running from my desk for a while.

Thankfully, nothing exploded.
