I've been fiddling about with small electronics recently, specifically
the [Arduino], which is a microcontroller/prototyping board. The
boards have gotten way cheap (standard ones are around 20-30 quid, less
if you want fewer I/O ports or a specialised board layout you need to
solder bits onto.

The hard part, I've found, is thinking of things to make. In the
meantime I'm practicing soldering, using projects like making a few
ProtoShields, and the LOLShield.

Last night, I made a functional RFID reader, using less than 50 euro
worth of parts, which for a long-time hardware luddite was extremely
fulfilling. I even managed to solder without burning myself or others.

I've got one or two projects in mind, mainly around wireless sensors and
[domotics], which I'll put up here (hey, I have to put something here,
right?).
