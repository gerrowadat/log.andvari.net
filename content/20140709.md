Starting to move. First, large furniture items, so rented another van from another place, and moved bed, TV stuff, various other bits. A slight oversight means I don't have a functional bed anywhere. Thankfully, I have a nice couch. It feels a lot more real and the house in Clane feels a lot more bare.

Later, headed up to Bellurgan for a site walkaround and meeting about a large [Airsoft] game, [The Rionegro Insurgency], I'm helping with running next month. Five weeks to go, and surely more about this as the time gets nearer.

Sleep time. I have the Van tomorrow again, so will get the last of the large stuff moved, and can then move smaller bits at my leisure (this is the theory).
