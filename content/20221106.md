It's November! That most wonderful time of the year when your brain and being need a little more maintenance.

Part of my maintenance schedule is taking the worsening weather as a prompt to feel less guilty about not going outside and doing outside things -- i.e. getting to coding and home sysadmin projects before [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com/) kicks off.

Having ditched [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io) at home for various reasons, I've been running [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) instead for homelab stuff. It is a lot more straightforward for my purposes, and reminds me a lot more of [Borg](https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/) from my time in the chocolate mines.

I'd also been running [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) for service discovery (mostly via DNS interface), and was planning on doing proper secrets management with Vault -- However, [Nomad 1.4](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/nomad-1-4-adds-nomad-variables-and-updates-service-discovery) added a few nice features, including something that's not as shiny as Vault, but works for my own purposes. So, I was looking to slim back to just Nomad and get rid of the rest of the ecosystem entirely.

After racking my brains for a cool and down-with-the-kids project name, enter [nomad-dns-exporter](https://github.com/gerrowadat/nomad-dns-exporter), which is now happily pointing nginx and other various scripts and such at nomad services via DNS, no consul required (unless I turn down consul and discover it is, of course :-))

It's a homelab, so I get to replace some proper software with duct tape, and learned a few things along the way -- so, homelab mission accomplished!
