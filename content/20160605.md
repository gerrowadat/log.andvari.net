The weather turns and turns. We're well into the season where things spring out, and make you cut them back,
or just be happy they're there. Our garden has rhubarb. Enough for a tiny put of jam, or perhaps
a Mr. Kipling's style rhubarb tartlet or two.

It also is the season for camping, weekend activities that involve outside, and being on the motorbike a
lot more. I was away for much of last week, looking forward to more of the outside, assuming the last 
week or so wasn't a trick.
