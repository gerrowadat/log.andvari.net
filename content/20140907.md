First week back at work - done!

Things have been more physically tiring than otherwise. I've been trying to nail down the next couple of months travel wise, and managed to make it into work on the bike 
two days out of five, which was good. That's been helped along by some good weather, and unhelped by some [impatient drivers] (that get caught on my helmet cam and youtubed).

This weekend saw some Airsoft, and some moving of larger items from the old house. It's not quite the insuroutable chore I've assumed it would be any more, a couple more trips will do it, I think.
