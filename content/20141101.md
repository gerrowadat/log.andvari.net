Off to Mountain View in the morning for 3 days, then onwards to New York. I haven't been to MTV since January, or NYC since June, so I guess I'm due in both.

This is the aeroplane survival kit. I don't sleep on planes, and Aer Lingus have transatlantic WiFi now, so this is indispensble. That's the work phone (Nexus 4), work tablet (Nexus 10), and the newly-acquired Moto 360 smartwatch, which the jury is still out on (pretty shiny so far though).

Three other pieces of indisensible kit are:

  - [Anker ASTRO E5] battery pack for charging hungry gadgets on the road.
  - [Anker] 5-way USB charging thingo (2.4A on each of 5 ports for maximum charging goodness)
  - [ASUS WL-330NUL] USB ethernet and mobile hotspot, for sharing stupid one-mac-address wifi with all your gadgets (seriously, everyone should have one of these).

Hopefully I'll get some stuff done on the plane - I've yet to properly emulate the distraction-deprivation environment that planes give you.

Seeya on the other side, internet.
