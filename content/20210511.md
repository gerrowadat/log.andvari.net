Let's try every week or so? No excuses about no time :-)

The last week or two have been decompressing, switching off. I found/find myself unable to do most of the technical/outside/etc. stuff that would usually count as "Doing stuff I want", in favour of a sort of haze of...meh? It's not even "Oh, woe is me", it's more of a "Nope" to doing basically anything. I take it as the brain trying to heal itself :-)

So, that's what that's like :-) I can already feel things lifting, though -- so I think once there's a little more structure I'll be good to go. I do realise it's up to me to provide it, so that's this week's job.

I have been able to get out a bunch, though. Yesterday was the first day when inter-county travel was allowed, so I made it out to the parents, for the first time since xmas. There is a significant backlog of being fed to be done.

Next week involves putting a bit of structure (i.e. fixing sleep cycle), starting small on some exercise, and maybe making a list of project work to do (I suspect learning about [prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is bubbling to the top of the backlog). I also need to fix my horrible hacky way of using local disk in Nomad allocs (squint your eyes and [behold](https://github.com/gerrowadat/shite/blob/main/examples/nomad_nfs_to_local.hcl)). Plus other stuff that's now popping into my head that means I should probably go and make that list now...
