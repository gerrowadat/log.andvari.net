Second week back, and seeing what my job ends up looking like for the next while. Think 'busy'. I'm trying to nail down travel until the end of the year, it being increasingly impossible. I'll be in Zurich for a while next week, and after that is anyone's guess.

Other delightful happenings: Someone working on another building in the campus our building is in managed to reverse a van into the motorbike. The only real damage was to the airblade windscreen, which got broken pretty much clean in half (see picture). After removing the remains, I discovered that all it was really doing was redirecting wind into my face, and riding the bike got a bit nicer to do. So, thanks clumsy van driver I guess.
