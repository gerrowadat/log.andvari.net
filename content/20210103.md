I'm now most of the way through the ~month or so I took off work. Around the start of it, I made a few plans, but I also resolved to unapologetically spend much of it just relaxing, and feeling non-guilty about that. It's something I've been working on, and I'm fairly pleased with the results. Sometimes the things you do are for you. It's one of the things I know and then steadfastly refuse my own counsel on.

One of the outcomes was solving a few of the outstanding home and home automation things I've been loking at doing for ages. The above is a [Shelly 1](https://shelly.cloud/) connected to the pinout of my garage door opener. I didn't have much say in what kind of opener and ended up with the kind with an Internet of Shit widget that just doesn't work properly, and a Manufacturer that don't take too kindly to hobbyists by not publishing any schematics. Thankfully, I happened to know that shorting two of the terminals on the back worked the same as a remote control press, and here we are.

One of the outcomes (unplanned, but here we are) of this break was that i've started writing code agin in earnest. I hope it lasts when I go back to work; I partially credit [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com/) and some nice folks over on the [Irish Tech community Slack](https://irishtechcommunity.slack.com) for that -- but i've picked up on some other stuff as well. (btw, my attempts up until I ran ot of time are on [github](https://github.com/gerrowadat/adventofcode/tree/main/2020), including practicing on previous years).

(I guess if this is the last entry for another year or two, you'll know how going back to work went).
