'Tis the season, apparently.

One more stint of travel before the long and well-anticipated 2 weeks
off work for xmas. I've only had one unbroken year in the streak of
taking these 2 weeks off before in my entire working life -- I get very
grumpy if it doesn't work out.

The last few weeks have been progressively colder at home, so the
heating has been bumped up a notch and the [Slanket] has been seeing
more and more use. That tiny roundy cat you see above is also starting
to disappear under the duvet for the day when I'm out. Outside, it's got
that damp, crisp thing going on. I think I've gotten back to liking this
time of year. The last few have been not so good, for reasons I got
basically sorted out this year, so in a way I feel like I'm missing
something by going away (that and Favourite Lady, of course).

I've been doing a little more Airsoft, when I can. You tend to only
really get the serious players out these days, so it's a little less
annoying. I've also gotten my ticket to [Berget] for next year. I
didn't go last year because I bought into the lame idea that I have to
bring an entire squad, but I think I'd like to head along even with one
or two people I know this time.

Work has been progressively more involving. I've been getting a lot more
code done recently, and am trying to find a balance between
direction-setting and getting-hands-dirty for the project. I'm
encouraged to find I still like getting my hands dirty, but there's
always last-minute phone calls to encourage people designing software to
not pull the theoretical hot saucepan down on top of themselves which
impinges on Make Time, as we're to call it these days.

I've also been looking again at [Domotics] -- I've picked up a Scooba,
a few Roombas, and am looking at lawn and garden automation for next
year. I'll do a proper post on this at some point. [Making Things
Talk] is a fascinating read so far, it may be the first paper book I
bring on a plane in a few years.

Speaking of which, I'm off to California on Sunday. I'm spending a week
with the Analytics development team (I manage the Analytics Frontend SRE
team), and then am in Seattle for 3 days with the Analytics Backend SRE
team. It's my first Mountain View visit in a good long while, almost a
year in fact. It'll be good to see videoconference peeps for realsies
for a change.
