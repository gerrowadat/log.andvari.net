Still fiddling with Pelican -- it's got a reasonably nice codebase, but the devs don't appear to be all that responsive. I've had to patch a few of their outstanding
pull requests already to get things working just-so, [this one] most notably. Also some fiddling with setting up a lightbox for images, and importing old stuff from Blogger.

Today in NYC wasn't as oppressively hot as yesterday (and probably about the same as at home. I think I might have missed the Irish summer in my 3-day trip away). At least they're less apologetic about air conditioning here.

One more day here and I get to go see if my new house is still standing.
