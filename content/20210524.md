Showed up to a few low-key conferences last week (Multitasking between [SLOconf](https://www.sloconf.com/) and [o11yfest](https://o11yfest.org/) for a few days).

It felt great to be catching up with some folks I hadn't in a while -- not having the GOOG hat on was a refreshing change. It's like the manager/director/VP/whatever hat in any job you're in - you like to imagine you can 
show up one day and sit backwards in a chair and say you're not a manager/director/whatever for a second, but that's not how it works. So let's say that showing up to a conference as a regular punter and as a Director at a FAANG are very different experiences.

Another good sign is signing up for a few more projects at home. While the month over xmas was home-assistant, then messing with Kubernetes before throwing it out in favour of [nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/), this break has been a lot more about really re-charging.

So this week, the bits arrived for one of the few projects I'm allowing myself (aside from home sysadmin). Since I'm a fan of stupidly simple interfaces, I wanted to do a 'traffic light' style interface for presence, that I can plug into Slack, or even other things (Slack is about to become a large part of my day-to-day workflow, as part of a global org, so presence is important). I know I could run [Keybow OS](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/setting-up-the-keybow-os) on it and mess about with LUA, but where's the fun in that?

The RPi Zero and keybow are dinky! I dunno, I still get a kick out of really tiny things that have a full userspace on them. I might see if I can pick up a small handful of Cherry MX Blue switches, since I dont' mind those three wee buttons being clicky (I run browns in my regular keyboard).

The code I've messed about with so far is [here](https://github.com/gerrowadat/anseo) ('anseo' means 'here' or 'present' in Irish). It also gave me a chance to actually learn more about asyncio in Python, which is a feature that appeared since the last time I wrote python code in anger, and looks much nicer than messing around with threads (so far...).
