Having nothing to write about but "I made soup!" is something of a dampener on things (I didn't make soup).

Part of the point of this log is to capture some of that upcoming leave of absence I'm taking from work - I'm taking all of July and August off, and this is my last week in work before
turning into a pumpkin.

The general idea is that if I've got nothing to write about every day or two, then I should probably be doing more stuff. I've put off a lot of things over the years, I should at least clear some things (I haven't made a list intentionally - that kind of invites disappointment, I think).

So, today was mostly sleeping and dealing with Jetlag. Tomorrow, hopefully less so.
