I'm spending this week in Israel, in The Company's Tel Aviv
office, doing some ninja work on Analytics production -- a bunch of
stuff gets done out of here, and I'm helping out the nice people here to
keep their services stable and non-annoying. I'm on the 26th floor of a
giant office building, and the view is amazing.

Tel Aviv beats my record for "Furthest east on a traditional world map",
the previous record held by Dubrovnik. I don't get to do a lot of
touristing this time, but they're at least threatening to bring me to
[Caesarea] later in the week. I also get to possibly walk around and
see Jaffa/Yafo on friday.

Didn't bring a more beefy camera than the Nexus One, so only a handful
of photos this time.
