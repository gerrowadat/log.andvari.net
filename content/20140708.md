A simple day in one way. Helped J move cats and possessions, rented a van and negotiated extremely tiny streets with same. Only managed to knock the wing mirror off once.

Afternoon-food in [Woodstock], which never disappoints. Om nom.

Heading out in the morning to pick up the van for my own move, of at least large pieces of furniture that don't fit in the jeep. Oh joy.
