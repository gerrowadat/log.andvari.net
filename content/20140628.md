I'm guessing it's going to take at least a week to figure out that I don't have a schedule. Sadly, house renovations mean I actually do have a schedule of people showing up for the next week or so.

Today, I failed to sell an Oven, and succeeded in buying a new Airsoft gun. So there's something.

I also lit the first fire in the new house, coincidentally because I needed to dry the place out for a floor that's being laid tomorrow.
