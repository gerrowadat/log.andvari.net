No photo today. If there was, it'd be a soiled lab coat with some scary-looking weaponry on it. Went to an afternoon/evening/overnight [Airsoft] game, with a Walking Dead theme -- I got to stick on a lab coat and pretend to do unspeakable things to walkers in a loft. This went on until 3am or so. Good times.

I'm only out of bed now, which gives me a low-level anxiety about wasting the day still. I've been trying to intentionally take some days off from "Things I have to do" for "Things I'd like to do", and this may end up being one. As of tomorrow, I have No Excuse Whatsoever to not move house, so today may well be not doing anything.
