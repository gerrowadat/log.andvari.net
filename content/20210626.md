After being asked by a work colleague to say words about OKRs and if they're a good thing to adopt, I realised I had more words than fit in an email or short doc -- so, here's a slightly longer doc on my view of OKRs, tempered by 15 years or so of using them fairly successfully, and seeing them used...less successfully. They're one of those "Google does them so let's do them too" type things that seem like a no-brainer, but can often mask the right answer for where your practice is at.

Anyway, say hello to [Working Deliberately with OKRs](/pages/working-deliberately-with-okrs.html) (with thanks to [@ahidalgosre](https://www.twitter.com/ahidalgosre) for casting a critical eye over it).
