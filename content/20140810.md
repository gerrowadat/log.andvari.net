A week between updates, but it's been a reasonably busy one. Still moving a bunch of stuff from the old house, still trying to get out on the (motor)bike every day or so (in between impressive rainshowers).

Friday was a small get-together with some folks, as a bit of a "Yep, I definitely live here now" wake-up call. The smaller touches are also happening, like home automation and the like. I think tis is possibly the first day I've been able to sit in the office and get some solid nerding done. I'm currently experimenting with using [LightwaveRF] stuff for light switches, since their switch gear is a bit cheaper and more predictable tan z-wave (which I'm using for everything else).

This week, I have to sort out some smaller bits (like the CCTV company that have left me waiting a solid 3 weeks to finish an install. Bad show, [MAC Alarms]). Also, some more moving (I still havent'e mptied the old house. The last big job is getting that rented out).

Back to the nerd-mobile.
