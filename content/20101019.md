It's getting to be toward the end of the year, time to resurrect the old
monolith.

I've been considering moving to [Wordpress], but wordpress is far too
annoying to set up, and I realise that most people read/skim via RSS and
don't care about delivery mechanisms. It's like putting letters you
write to your bank manager in lovely scented paper envelopes you made
yourself.

I've been doing a lot of travel recently, most recently to Seattle
(again) and Italy. Was also going to be going to Lisbon, but got my
annual dose of brain mush right before. I'm heading to Tel Aviv next
week, Barcelona with a Nice Lady in November, and Seattle in November
too. I'm personally responsible for [crying icebergs].

I'm not going to pretend like I'm going to update this more often, but
let's just say I'd like to. I'm feeling a little more like I'd like to
remember some of this stuff, and we won't have USA assorted biscuit tins
full of B&W negatives in 2050.
