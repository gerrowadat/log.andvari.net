I own a sealed copy of Katamari Damacy for the PS2. You find these things out when you're moving and doing a cull of crap. Why do I own this? I don't even own a PS2 any more.

This was probably most of the day. That, and being asleep. I've found that between one thing and another, I'm still having to get up in the morning. This is, as they say, not what I signed up for. Going to have to sort that one out.

The evening saw some [shooting of people], and then to bed for a delightful 5 hour nap, in time for getting up for the last of the builders (turning on the solar system, and the BER assessment).
