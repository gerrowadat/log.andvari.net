Work this past week has been a long trial of getting back up to speed
after Tel Aviv. Even though it's pretty much a regular week, catching up
my brain from all the stuff I promised to do, and getting back into the
stuff I was doing when I left had just about happened by today,
basically.

I'm currently looking into full-spectrum/white lighting, for home and
work. November is usually a bad brain month, in general. This year, I've
been continuing my theme of doing things pro-actively by attempting to
spend at least some of it outside the country (I'll be in Barcelona next
week, and heading to California at the end of the month), and the
aforementioned lighting. It makes a discernable
difference to overall mood if I'm working under one for the day.

The one bad thing, of course (and the reasons why hotels use low-light
yellow bulbs) is that it shows up every speck of dirt and dust in the
room. Once you can deal with this, I heartily endorse this event or
product. You feel less like you're holed up in a fortress of solitude,
and brighter lights (properly shaded) are in general good for your eyes.

I've been doing other brain stuff recently, which I'll get into. The
moral: making your brain work is damn useful if it's what pays your
bills.
