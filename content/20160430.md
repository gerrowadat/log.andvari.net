Back from a few days in Prague and beyond, at [Border War](https://www.borderwar.cz/). This was a very decent one - and
I ended up not being as wrecked as I thought (due to the previously mentioned unfitness). Did about 45km of hiking over the 
3 days of the event, which is a lot for me.

This (as usual) has sparked plans for more trips. Work has been busy (in a good way) for a while, so plans for non-work are 
spinning up, which I guess is the real sign of spring (I've got things I could be doing for about half the weekends until July already).

More of this sort of thing, plz.
