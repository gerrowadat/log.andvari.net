I fiddled a bit with this, so I thought I'd do a no-nonsense guide to
doing this. There are other guides, but a lot of them are incomplete and
will leave you with queueing issues or annoyances.

The science bit:

    :::python
    smtp_use_tls = yes
    smtp_sasl_auth_enable=yes
    smtp_sasl_password_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    smtp_sasl_security_options=noanonymous
    smtp_sasl_tls_security_options=noanonymous
    # Send all mail through smtp.gmail.com
    relayhost = smtp.gmail.com
    # Stop getting a catpcha, hopefully.
    smtp_destination_rate_delay = 60
    relay_destination_rate_delay = 60


Then, edit /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd:

    :::python
    smtp.gmail.com myemail@gmail.com:MyPaSsWoRd


It doesn't have to be an @gmail account,
it can be a GAFYD account, once you've logged into it once to activate
it.

Then just generate the map file for the
sasl_passwd file and reload. As root:

    :::python
    postmap sasl_passwd
    postfix reload

And you're done. Monitor your queue a few
times over the first few days to make sure stupid stuff hasn't happened
(the delay between mails might get tweaked), but in general this has
worked for me.

Have fun.
