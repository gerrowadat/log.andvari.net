2nd Van Day, and the old house is even barer. This will probably be my last sleep there. The cats get to stay here a while longer, until I have some painting and DIY and other non-cat-friendly stuff done.

The new house has what we assume is a colony of wild rabbits nearby, we usually scatter one or two whenever we walk around the back. They came in handy today when we left out some cuttings from a tree in the front, which they duly disposed of by nibbling and running around nervously.

Tomorrow I get solar panels turned on, and get to make a lot of phone calls (one of which will be about my being largely unable to make mobile phone calls in the new house. So Rural.).
