I was away last week with work to an offsite at the [Club Med](https://www.clubmed.co.uk/r/Opio-en-Provence/y), which as far as I can 
gather is one of those soviet-era collective holiday camps for people who weren't in a soviet. I bet the soviets never
had nespresso on demand.

Bizarrely, the weather in Ireland was actually better than in the south of France. No complaints though :-)

This week, the weather at home is fighting with itself -- sunshine and high (for Ireland) temperatures, with "showers" that range
in intensity from light drizzle to attempted murder. Will still try to bike it to work as I can this week. Actually the first
full week in many weeks, so trying to git 'er done moreso than I have been.
