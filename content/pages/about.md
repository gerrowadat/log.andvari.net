I am an [SRE][sre], Engineering Leadership practitioner and [Coach](https://www.strategichopes.co/) based in Dublin, Ireland. 

I am currently freelancing as a techologist leadership consultant and coach. For more on the consulting end of things, see [Co-Servant Systems](https://coservant.systems). For coaching, see [Strategic Hopes](https://www.strategichopes.co/).

As far as full-time roles go, I was most recently VP of Engineering at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), working on reliability strategery and leading the SRE group there.

Previous to that, I was Sr. Director of Engineering at [elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co), building and scaling Elastic Cloud.

I was a Site Reliability Engineer/Manager/Director at Google from 2004 to 2021. As well as technical and management/leadership work on products such as GMail and Google Analytics, I was the global lead for Storage and Databases SRE at Google, as well as the head of Engineering at Google Ireland for several years.

I hold various opinions about technology, building and keeping teams and organisations, the role of SRE/Devops/whatever the kool kids are calling it, and various other things. I have run orgs from individual teams up to orgs of 300+ engineers, managers and other functions.

I was responsible for the [first][ama1] and [second][ama2] Reddit AMAs participated in by SRE, and have given various talks, presentations, etc. externally about what Google Engineering, and specifically SRE, do. I'm the author of chapter 29 of the [SRE Book][srebook].

Speaking/Interviewing
=====================

I am happy to speak on subjects such as Software Resiliency, Customer Management for SaaS (internal and external), SRE history and development, OKRs, Managing Distributed Teams, Performance Management, Coaching high-level engineers and managers, Interrupts, on-call, incident management, and anything else that falls inside the realm of interesting and where I might have something interesting to say.

If in doubt, get in contact via LinkedIn or Mastodon or any of the various ways that can be figured out.
