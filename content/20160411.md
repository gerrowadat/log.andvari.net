I almost signed up for a medium account. A brief moment of madness before I realised that
the likes of medium accounts are also transient. Reminded, again, by my recent de-facto abandonment of G+ 
as a thing to publish things on. I am not a crackpot, our outlets for writing are transient and we're 
in danger of not having a narrative at all if (some of us) don't self-curate :-)

In since-last-year news, things are progressing, for certain values of progress. As far as the Internet at large is concerned,
 I now have about twice as many people who have the good|bad|indifferent fortune of being in my organisation at work (I know,
"my organisation", right?). Things have gotten really busy since about the start of this year, but in a good way.

It is my solemn belief that the average person should know how to do about 90% of their job. Thereabouts.

I also wrote a chapter for the [SRE Book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do). Not on anything technical
of course. On manager-nerd stuff. A dabbler in code and people. It was a paper I'd had sitting internally for a while, that 
is now seeing the light of day, in edited form. I am glad this book exists, as I have honestly believed that what we're doing is
capital-I Important.

I also get on. I get on okay. How are you?
