Eating an actual meal in what was essentially a building site a week or so ago is a strange experience.

In any case, today was waaaaay less productive than I thought it would be -- the last vestiges of Builder disapeared (the skip full of old stuff), and I got a new freezer. Aside from that I played a bunch of [Hearthstone], which I'm not sure I like yet, and moved a few small bits from house to house. Tomorrow will be probably a writeoff too, going to do some shopping...
