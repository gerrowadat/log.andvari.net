My capacity to think of a witty title for every day is going to run dry eventully, so let's try this for a title convention -- protip: posts with the date as a title probably either have limited re-sale value or were boring in the first place :-)

Today I went and played some Airsoft, then met J in [IKEA] and picked up a few small bits (no furniture yet, or at all from IKEA if I get my way), then headed home via seeing the new floor. This was the last unfinished surface in the house, the walls and ceilings having been finished yesterday post-windows.

Since it was a big floor (spanning two rooms), we decided to go fairly swish, and weren't disappointed.
