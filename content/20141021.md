At a work conference in Munich, which I've never been to before. From what I have seen of restaurants here, it is a Paleo disaster, so I've been pretty cheat-y so far.

As middle-european cities go, it's pretty nice -- ageing but efficient train service, pants-shitting taxi rides from the airport at 220kph, and good food and company.

I get to spend essentially no free time here, but maybe I'll come back sometime. For now, I get to go back home for a week, then do a short-in-duration but long-in-distance jaunt. The joy.
